look through all these and i'll leave this voice note because i think it's easier for me to free
flow through it so yeah i think you are right that was more of a structural polish than a visual
polish i think the structure looks really nice um so you highlighted the reasons that it feels
basic which i agree with yeah like there's no custom icon libraries just stylized text
not really a logo there's no gold bars ball take no imagery i guess flat graphics and generic feel
so um let me look through the reasons you said what we need to make it pop
yes i agree with the logo and brand mark um do you think that those tools are good for ai like the
generations are good for logos or should we do the svg concepts i guess i'll kind of leave that up to
you um really quickly i think that we aren't going to move forward with comfyui slash flux um last time
we tried to do it i feel like it took up way too much compute on the hardware that we're running and
so i don't think that's going to be the right path forward um and so yeah i mean even if we decided
to use mid journey or something else like the artist toolkit or whatever um i do think that i need your
guidance here on if we do ai generations for a new logo or svg concepts and kind of like what that looks
like uh for professional icons um yeah i actually don't really know what lucide or phosphor are um and
then the idea of generating customs uh and then so let's see real imagery i agree um and then yes
sophisticated graphics would be awesome i think and so yeah all the data visualization the flywheel
instructions the animated elements um okay so tools i mentioned comfyui and i know right now we don't
have mid journey or the artist toolkit um okay i'm looking through those things so uplash as far as that
goes like is that pretty solid uh you say it's like free but do we need to like make an account and log
in is it just like a database to search from um svg design we already asked the questions on that and then
yeah browser ai tools i'll let you kind of guide me there too so yeah now you're saying uh
the recommendations one more pass
yeah i mean before we even answer those i'd kind of like to answer these questions a little bit more
and then just generally speaking i think whatever we decide here would be awesome to save and kind of a
i don't want to call it a skill but some sort of thing that we like catalog of like okay if we're
doing these things like don't just produce the flat version of sophisticated polish like all the
sophisticated polish not just like the the layout and everything all right i want a visual polish
not just like a layout and everything so um let's just kind of go through that and like make sure yeah
when we do decide on something like this and get all the clarity then we can down the road like say
this yeah okay this is a great option like i want to do that moving forward
