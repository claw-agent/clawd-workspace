## Daily Reset (5:55 AM)

Fresh day. Context at 13%, running clean.

### Yesterday's Highlights (Feb 2):
- Built **Weekly Twitter Insights** synthesis system
- Fixed **Scout Alpha** reliability (tiered analysis, retry logic, auth pre-check)
- Created **Skill Gap Analysis** (overall 7.5/10, key gaps: calendar, email, image consistency)
- Built **Spawn Templates** library for common sub-agent tasks

### Carry-forward Issues:
- ~95% of bookmarks lack summaries (scout analysis pipeline needs attention)
- Google Workspace OAuth still pending (would unlock calendar + email for briefs)

## Proactive Work Session (11:00 AM)

Picked "Cleanup cruft" from PROACTIVE-IDEAS.md.

### Created: Workspace Cleanup Audit
**File:** `~/clawd/reports/cleanup-audit-2026-02-03.md`

**Key Findings:**
- Total workspace: ~3.2GB
- Potential savings: ~710MB

**Top cleanup candidates:**
1. slc-lead-gen/node_modules — 188MB (project dormant)
2. sim-studio — 522MB (not actively used, 135 commits behind)
3. Old morning reports (>7 days) — ~15MB

**Safe to clean immediately:**
- `rm -rf ~/clawd/projects/slc-lead-gen/node_modules`
- `trash ~/clawd/sim-studio`

## Proactive Work Session (5:00 PM)

Built the **Focus Group Agent System** — reusable personas for simulated product/content reviews.

### What I Created:
**Location:** `~/clawd/agents/focus-group/`

**Components:**
- `SKILL.md` — Full documentation on how to run focus groups
- 12 detailed persona profiles in `personas/` directory

**Consumer Personas:**
- busy-parent.md — Sarah Chen, 38, time-starved marketing manager
- skeptical-boomer.md — Rick Thompson, 61, trust-must-be-earned sales vet
- tech-early-adopter.md — Zoe Martinez, 29, product designer in Austin
- budget-conscious.md — Aiden Park, 23, grad student watching every dollar
- affluent-pro.md — Victoria Sterling, 44, Park City consultant who values premium

**B2B Personas:**
- smb-owner.md — Marcus Williams, 47, SLC electrical contractor (12 employees)
- enterprise-buyer.md — David Okoro, 49, Fortune 500 VP IT ($40M budget)
- startup-founder.md — Priya Sharma, 34, Series A founder in SF

**Expert Personas:**
- ux-designer.md — Jordan Liu, Airbnb alum, focuses on conversion/accessibility
- marketing-strategist.md — Elena Vasquez, ex-CMO, positioning expert
- sales-veteran.md — Tony Brennan, 28yr B2B sales, buyer psychology
- copywriter.md — Marcus Chen, conversion copy specialist

### Usage:
```bash
# Spawn a consumer panel
sessions_spawn task="Read ~/clawd/agents/focus-group/personas/busy-parent.md. Review: [URL]."
sessions_spawn task="Read ~/clawd/agents/focus-group/personas/skeptical-boomer.md. Review: [URL]."

# Spawn an expert panel
sessions_spawn task="Read ~/clawd/agents/focus-group/personas/ux-designer.md. Critique: [URL]."
```

**Why this matters:** Addresses the "focus group / persona reviews" pattern observed in PROACTIVE-IDEAS.md. Now we can run consistent, repeatable simulated focus groups for landing pages, pitch decks, product concepts, etc.

## 🐛 Debugging Session: Dual-Response Crisis (9:18-10:00 PM)

**Symptom:** Two different responses appearing for the same Telegram message simultaneously.

**Investigation:**
- Marb sent 35 screenshots showing the issue
- Analyzed gateway logs, session files, compaction events
- Found `totalActive=2` in logs (initially thought it was the bug)

**Root Cause:**
During earlier diagnostics, I called `gateway config.schema` which dumped ~200KB JSON into context. This single tool call ate 75% of the context window, causing:
1. Session grew to 258k tokens (over 200k limit)
2. Compaction triggered but failed (too big to summarize)
3. System entered unstable state → dual responses

**Fixes Applied:**
1. Lowered pruning thresholds: softTrimRatio=0.4, hardClearRatio=0.55
2. Ran /new to reset session

**Lesson:** Don't call massive-output tools like config.schema. Use `| head` on potentially large outputs.

**Verdict:** NOT a Clawdbot bug — self-inflicted by bad tool usage.
