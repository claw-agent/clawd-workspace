# OpenClaw outbound file sends must use ~/.openclaw/media/
**Date:** 2026-02-16
**Lesson:** Sending files via the message tool only works from `~/.openclaw/media/`. Any other path (~/clawd/reports/, /tmp/, etc.) fails with "not under an allowed directory." Always copy files there before sending.
**Applied to:** Morning report delivery prompt, any future file sends.
