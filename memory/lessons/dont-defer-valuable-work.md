# Don't defer valuable work — build it when it matters
**Date:** 2026-02-16
**Lesson:** Marb called out pattern of "cataloging for later" instead of building. If something is clearly valuable and buildable now, build it. Deferring is lazy and doesn't match our "action > permission" work style.
**Trigger:** Over-correcting on context conservation led to suggesting "save for later" on memory architecture upgrades and skill evolution — both of which we then built in the same session.
