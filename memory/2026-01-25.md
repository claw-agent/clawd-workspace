## Qwen3-TTS Voice Cloning Setup ✅

Set up local voice cloning with Qwen3-TTS:
- **Voice**: Tim Gerard Reynolds (Red Rising narrator)
- **Reference**: 30 seconds of Morning Star opening narration
- **Location**: `~/clawd/voices/claw_reference.wav`
- **Script**: `~/clawd/scripts/claw-speak.sh "text" [output.wav]`

### What worked:
- 30-second reference with simple (x-vector) mode
- Morning Star emotional narration > credits intro
- Clean audiobook recording from Marb's screen capture

### What didn't work:
- Transcript mode with 60s reference (OOM killed)
- Credits/intro voice (too flat, not his narration voice)
- YouTube compressed audio (lower quality)

### Performance:
- Model load: ~8 seconds
- Generation: ~2x real-time (10s audio = ~20s generation)
- Quality: Good voice match, Marb approved V4

## Notes
- Marb is on book 4 of Red Rising, no spoilers past that
- "Per aspera ad astra" - through hardships to the stars (Red Rising motto)

## Twitter Bookmark Analysis 📑

Analyzed 17 bookmarks from @ClawA94248 account. State saved to `memory/bookmarks-state.json`.

### Deep Dives Completed:
1. **#3 @NetworkChuck** — Server phone + Claude Code via 3CX VoIP. YouTube tutorial.
2. **#4 @nicbstme (Fintool CEO)** — MASSIVE article on AI agents for fintech
   - Sandbox required for multi-step agent workflows
   - Skills-as-markdown is the future (not prompt engineering)
   - S3-first architecture (YAML files > database)
   - Temporal for long-running tasks
   - Domain-specific evals essential
3. **#5 @shawn_pana** — agent-browser by Vercel + browser_use for authenticated sites
4. **#9 @hayesdev_** — Company structure as .md files (skills templates)
   - Files at: aiagentskit.com/blog/claude-ag
   - Basically the skills-as-markdown pattern applied to org design
5. **#13 @brave** — Brave Search API for Clawdbot
   - Free tier available at brave.com/search/api
   - Ad-free, tracking-free, independent search index

### To Review Later:
- **#16 @NirDiamantAI** — everything-claude-code repo (github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code)

### Key Insights:
- Skills-as-markdown is becoming industry standard (Anthropic Agent Skills spec)
- File system + bash = optimal agent abstraction (not just SQL/RAG)
- "The model is not your product. The experience around the model is your product."

## Remotion Video Setup ✅

Installed and tested Remotion for programmatic video creation:
- **Location:** `~/clawd/projects/remotion-test/my-video/`
- **Skill file:** `~/clawd/skills/remotion/SKILL.md`
- **Test output:** 5-second 1080p video rendered in ~3s

Use cases: menu board videos, social clips, data visualizations

## Skills/Roles Directory Proposal

Marb approved creating a skills/roles structure based on Fintool + .md employees patterns.

### Proposed Structure:
```
skills/
├── roles/           # "Employee" personas
│   ├── researcher.md
│   ├── analyst.md
│   ├── content-writer.md
│   ├── lead-gen-specialist.md
│   ├── developer.md
│   └── executive-assistant.md
├── workflows/       # Multi-step processes
├── tools/           # Tool-specific skills
└── domains/         # Industry knowledge
```

### First batch to create:
1. researcher.md
2. lead-gen-specialist.md  
3. content-writer.md
4. executive-assistant.md

### NetworkChuck Phone Agent
Marb interested in 3CX/Twilio voice interface (server calls you when things break).
We have: Whisper (STT) + edge-tts/Qwen3-TTS (TTS)
Need: Twilio or 3CX telephony bridge + webhook server

## Reminders Set

- **4pm today:** Codex 5.2 vs Opus 4.5 comparison for coding (cron job: codex-vs-opus-reminder)

---

## Browser Decisions

- Current browser setup (Playwright via Clawdbot) is fine for now
- agent-browser/browser_use → only if we hit auth issues
- Brave Search API → explore later for research quality

## Video Production Pipeline Built ✅

Created agent-driven video production workflow for Bjorn's Brew social ad.

### Key Insight
Critics reviewing SPECS miss real visual issues. Need QA agent reviewing actual PIXELS (extracted frames).

### Pipeline
```
Brief → Creative Director → Art Director → Code → Render → Frame Extract → Video QA → Fix → Loop
```

### Agents Used:
1. **Creative Director** — Refines brief, emotional arc, storytelling
2. **Art Director** — Colors, typography, animation specs
3. **Motion Critic** — Spring configs, timing, polish details
4. **Video QA** — Reviews extracted frames, catches visual bugs

### V1-V4 Evolution:
- V1: Basic SVG placeholders, generic brown gradient
- V2: Agent-refined colors (Copper Roast, Blue Merle), better springs
- V3: Real photos (Unsplash), background music (Pixabay), improved layout
- V4: QA fixes — faster hook, longer text hold, no ghosting, readable donation stat

### Common Issues Caught:
- Text fading too fast (12 frames → 25 frames)
- Ghost text bleeding through transitions
- Text unreadable on busy backgrounds (add rgba backdrop)
- Hook too slow (delay 12 → delay 3)

### Files Created:
- `~/clawd/skills/video-production/SKILL.md` — Reusable workflow
- `~/clawd/projects/bjorns-brew/video-ad/` — Remotion project

### Free Tools Stack:
- Unsplash — Stock photos
- Pixabay — Royalty-free music
- Remotion — React video framework
- ffmpeg — Frame extraction for QA
