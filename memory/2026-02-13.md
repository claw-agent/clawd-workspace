## Seedance 2.0 Mystery Solved (1:48 AM)
- ChatCut has explicit "BETA Seedance 2.0" button on homepage
- Must click it or defaults to Veo 3 (explains "veo3_video" filename on first test)
- Gala duel (Darrow vs Cassius) submitted with Seedance 2.0 confirmed
- Queue position ~5937/7025 — ~25hr wait (went public today, everyone slamming it)
- Seedance 2.0 officially public per @Gossip_Goblin tweet

## XPERIENCE Pricing Tool Final (12:59 AM)
All done. Marb happy. Data sources + raw data view added as final touch.

## 1:00 AM — Proactive: Demo Pipeline Script
- Built `~/clawd/projects/slc-lead-gen/demo-pipeline.sh`
- One command: URL → Lighthouse score → template demo site → Vercel deploy → email draft
- All high-value proactive items now complete ✅

## 3am Proactive: XPERIENCE Systems Integration Guide
- Built `~/clawd/systems/XPERIENCE-SYSTEMS-GUIDE.md`
- Maps all 7 XPERIENCE systems with architecture diagram, commands, dependencies
- Added 3 new proactive ideas: ops dashboard, quote PDF generator, lead CRM

## Morning Brief Delivered (7am)
OpenClaw 2026.2.12 available, Seedance public, Spotify Honk, Harness Problem.

## Seedance 2.0 — Attempt 3 & 4 (7pm-9pm)
- Attempt 3 via subagent: submitted but monitor cron found blank page (auth expired)
- Monitor cron disabled itself
- Attempt 4: spawned long-running subagent to stay on page — burned 180K context polling, never got video
- **Marb tried manually in Chrome** — worked! Generated fast.
- Refined prompt for Round 2: more Red Rising accurate (futuristic attire, razors not sabers, brown not golden hair, more extravagant fight)

## ChatCut Learnings
- ChatCut requires browser tab to stay open (client-side generation)
- Automated approaches keep failing — auth expires, polling burns context
- Manual generation by Marb works fine; our role = prompt crafting + analysis

## Supplement Stack Discussion (evening)
- Marb shared his stack: Thorne AM/PM multi, 12.5g creatine, 10K IU vitamin D, omega-3, glutathione spray
- Analyzed tweet from @jpowfleshlight — rated 7/10
- Recommended Marb add K2 (with high-dose D3) and mag L-threonate for sleep
- Marb's stack is cleaner and more practical than the tweet's

## System Health Audit (3pm)
- Score: 8/10, all 12 cron jobs clean, zero errors
- MEMORY.md at 2.1KB (well under 5K limit)
- Minor cleanup opportunities flagged (stale bookmark files, old reports)

## 10:30 PM — Compound Review
### Patterns That Worked
1. **Prompt iteration > automation** — for ChatCut, crafting better prompts was more valuable than building elaborate automation
2. **Overnight swarm pipeline** — 4/4 scouts succeeded, 61 items, clean compile+deliver
3. **Proactive overnight work** — demo pipeline + systems guide built without being asked
4. **Honest status reporting** — telling Marb "ChatCut is broken, here are options" instead of trying again

### Gotchas
1. **ChatCut can't be automated reliably** — auth expires, client-side generation needs live browser tab
2. **Long-polling subagents burn context** — 180K tokens polling every 30s for an hour = total waste
3. **Don't spawn subagents for tasks that need persistent browser state** — they'll exhaust context

### Preferences Learned
- Marb is interested in supplements/health optimization — engaged deeply with stack analysis
- Marb prefers to do browser-based tasks himself when automation fails, just needs the prompts/info
- Red Rising details matter — corrected hair color, weapon type, fighting style, attire

### Key Decisions
- ChatCut monitor cron disabled (auth issues make it useless)
- Manual ChatCut + prompt crafting is the workflow going forward

### Open Items
1. Seedance 2.0 Round 2 result (Marb generating manually)
2. OpenClaw upgrade to 2026.2.12 (flagged in morning brief, not yet done)
3. Agent primitives remaining: persistent shells, permission scoping, eval framework
4. XPERIENCE proactive ideas: ops dashboard, quote PDF generator, lead CRM
