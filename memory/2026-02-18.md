# Daily Notes — Feb 18, 2026

## 1:00 AM — Overnight Proactive Session

All proactive ideas completed — refreshed the list with new ones.

### Work Done
1. **Cron cleanup** — Removed 4 disabled one-off crons (weekly-tech-digest, 30-day-trend-report, Dreamina monitor, ChatCut monitor). 12 active crons remain, all healthy (0 consecutive errors).

2. **Feb daily notes archived** — Moved Feb 8-12 (25K chars) to `memory/archive/february-2026-week2-daily-notes.md`. Trimmed originals to redirect stubs.

3. **Episodic.md refreshed** — Removed stale pending items (Chrome DevTools MCP, skill description routing), updated recently completed, cleaned project statuses.

4. **Git housekeeping** — Committed 5 uncommitted files, pushed. Then found ralph-loops/dashboard/node_modules (624 files, 3.9M) tracked in git — untracked it, added to .gitignore.

5. **Skills usage audit** — All 24 skills get usage in last 7 days. Top: twitter-research (416 refs), morning-report (68), skill-audit (58). No dead skills to prune. ralph-loops is largest at 4.1M (mostly node_modules, now fixed).

6. **System health** — Score 7/10. Disk 20% used (65G free). All crons passing. Memory at 45 files (456K).

7. **Fresh proactive ideas seeded** — Added 10 new ideas across High/Medium value tiers: workspace disk audit, morning report quality review, agent cost tracker, XPERIENCE demo reel, spawn template refresh, research folder pruning, weekly recap automation, etc.

### Observations
- System is running lean and healthy after weeks of building
- All original proactive ideas (25+) have been completed over the past 3 weeks
- Next high-value targets are optimization/quality work rather than new builds
