# Daily Notes — Feb 18, 2026

## 1:00 AM — Overnight Proactive Session

All proactive ideas completed — refreshed the list with new ones.

### Work Done
1. **Cron cleanup** — Removed 4 disabled one-off crons (weekly-tech-digest, 30-day-trend-report, Dreamina monitor, ChatCut monitor). 12 active crons remain, all healthy (0 consecutive errors).
2. **Feb daily notes archived** — Moved Feb 8-12 (25K chars) to `memory/archive/february-2026-week2-daily-notes.md`. Trimmed originals to redirect stubs.
3. **Episodic.md refreshed** — Removed stale pending items (Chrome DevTools MCP, skill description routing), updated recently completed, cleaned project statuses.
4. **Git housekeeping** — Committed 5 uncommitted files, pushed. Found ralph-loops/dashboard/node_modules (624 files, 3.9M) tracked in git — untracked it, added to .gitignore.
5. **Skills usage audit** — All 24 skills get usage in last 7 days. Top: twitter-research (416 refs), morning-report (68), skill-audit (58). No dead skills to prune. ralph-loops is largest at 4.1M (mostly node_modules, now fixed).
6. **System health** — Score 7/10. Disk 20% used (65G free). All crons passing. Memory at 45 files (456K).
7. **Fresh proactive ideas seeded** — Added 10 new ideas across High/Medium value tiers.

## 3:00 AM — Proactive: Morning Report Quality Review

Analyzed last 5 morning reports (Feb 13-17) against Marb's actual engagement patterns.

### 5 Problems Found & Fixed
1. **Item repetition** — Chrome DevTools MCP in 4/5 reports. Created `reports/delivered-items.json` dedup tracker.
2. **Too many GitHub repos** — 10-14 daily, Marb acts on 1-2. Capped at 3 max.
3. **Action items are wishlists** — Split to 🔴 decisions + 🟢 I'll handle it.
4. **Over-analyzed bookmarks** — Simplified to one line each.
5. **Text summary too long** — ~500 words, now targeting ~300 with Top 3 not Top 5.

Changes: updated compile.md prompt, created delivered-items.json, wrote research/morning-report-quality-review.md.

## 7:00 AM — Morning Report Delivered
Feb 18 report delivered (PDF + text). First report using improved format.

## Afternoon — Main Session (Interactive)
- 290 compaction events in main session — very heavy context day
- 90 web_fetch errors (mostly 404s from GitHub link checking in research — known issue, not actionable)
- No interactive work with Marb today beyond morning report delivery

## 10:30 PM — Compound Review

### Patterns That Worked
- **Proactive quality audits** — Reviewing own output (morning reports) against user engagement is high-value self-improvement
- **Batch housekeeping** — Cron cleanup + git cleanup + archive in one overnight session is efficient
- **Dedup tracking** — delivered-items.json prevents morning report item repetition

### Gotchas
- **Main session 4125 lines / 12.7MB** — heaviest session file, lots of web_fetch 404s inflating it
- **290 compactions** — suggests context is being burned on background operations; investigate if cron sessions are contributing

### Preferences Learned
- Marb didn't interact much today — respect quiet days, don't create work
- Morning report improvements should be tested over several days before declaring success

### Drift Check
- ✅ No deferred work — overnight sessions completed all planned items
- ✅ No unauthorized external actions
- ✅ No recommending tools we already have
- ⚠️ Observation: Main session accumulated 12.7MB — this is the largest session file. May need session rotation or cleanup strategy.

### Subagent Observability (18 sessions in 24h)
- All crons ran on schedule: github-sentinel (6x), proactive (2x), overnight-research, morning-report-compile, morning-report-deliver, nightly-git-push, skill-evolution, compound-review
- No failed sessions
- No empty/minimal output sessions
- Largest cron session: morning-report-compile at 132K (normal for research aggregation)
- 4 deleted sessions from overnight (cleanup working as expected)

### Open Items
1. Morning report items #5+ still pending review with Marb
2. Chatterbox TTS evaluation (episodic.md)
3. Morning report PDF delivery path fix
4. Convert remaining workflows to proper skills
