# Daily Notes - January 26, 2026

## Overnight Research Session (~midnight - 12:20am)

### Completed: Morning Report for Marb
Analyzed all 22 bookmarks from Marb's X account. Deliverables ready:

**Deliverables:**
- `~/clawd/reports/morning-2026-01-26/morning-report-2026-01-26.pdf` (228KB, 2 pages)
- `~/clawd/reports/morning-2026-01-26/morning-summary-2026-01-26.wav` (3.9MB, 81.5s)

### Key Findings from Bookmarks

**Three Major Themes:**
1. **Open-source AI killing commercial tools** — Qwen3-TTS, PersonaPlex-7B destroying ElevenLabs
2. **Closed-loop software development** — @bqbrady's vision of fully autonomous feature → code → ship
3. **Clawdbot ecosystem exploding** — Brave amplifying, Lenny Rachitsky calling it "under-hyped"

**Categorized Actions:**
- **Resource Bank:** Agent scaffolding research (54.3% SWE-Bench-Pro with scaffolding vs 52% vanilla), @burakeregar security guide
- **Implement:** `ollama launch` (one-command Claude Code), skills.sh platform, Brave Search API
- **Refine:** Study @altryne tips thread, validate our AGENTS.md approach

**Notable Posts:**
- @ErnestoSOFTWARE: "10 apps in 10 months, $800k/yr" — 2.6M views, 31K bookmarks (MASSIVE)
- @brave + Clawdbot guide: 665K views, 6.9K bookmarks
- @geerlingguy "ElevenLabs nuked": 838K views, 14K bookmarks
- @HuggingModels PersonaPlex-7B: 1.5M views — full-duplex voice is hot

### Technical Notes
- Qwen3-TTS took ~168 seconds to generate 81.5 seconds of audio (RTF: 2.06x)
- Model loads in ~10 seconds on Mac mini M4
- Typst PDF compilation working well — watch out for `$` and `@` escaping

### Pending
- Marb to review report when he wakes (~8am MST)
- Phase 2: Browse my own X feed (optional if time permits)

## Skill Created: Twitter Research (12:15am)

**Problem:** Morning report analyzed ALL 22 bookmarks instead of just 6 NEW ones. Also ran too fast (12:20am) instead of doing deep overnight research.

**Fix:**
1. Created `skills/twitter-research/SKILL.md` with proper workflow
2. State tracking: `memory/twitter-research-state.json` tracks analyzed tweet IDs
3. Only NEW bookmarks get researched (compared against state)
4. Cron updated:
   - 11pm: Overnight deep research starts (not quick scan)
   - 7am: Morning delivery (moved from 8am)

**Lesson:** When Marb says "overnight research", he means DEEP DIVES running all night, not quick generation at midnight.

## System Audit (~12:30-12:45am)

Marb requested full system check via voice message.

### Issues Found & Fixed:
1. **111 orphan lock files** — removed
2. **59 deleted sessions** (~10MB) — purged
3. **Voice test artifacts** (~390MB) — cleaned from scripts/
4. **Memory index dirty** — re-indexed

### Disk Savings: ~400MB total

### Key Finding on "Precision Memory Problem":
Sessions are **isolated by design**. Cron jobs start fresh without context from other sessions. This is intentional, not a bug.

**Solution:** Ensure cron jobs explicitly read:
- HEARTBEAT.md (current focus)
- memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md (recent context)
- MEMORY.md (long-term context)

### Report Saved:
`~/clawd/reports/system-audit-2026-01-26.md` (comprehensive writeup)

## Clawdbot Updates Audit (~12:50am)

Marb reviewed my analysis of Clawdbot changelog vs our custom solutions.

### Decisions Made:

| Solution | Decision | Reason |
|----------|----------|--------|
| speak.sh (edge-tts) | Keep for fallback | Qwen3-TTS + Claw voice is our primary |
| Qwen3-TTS + Claw voice | ✅ Keep | Unique voice cloning, superior quality |
| memory_search | ✅ Now reliable | Tested 3 queries, all returned accurate results (scores 0.4-0.77) |
| grep workaround | ❌ Dropped | No longer needed — local embeddings working |
| gateway-health-check.sh | ❌ Removed | Clawdbot's native lock file fixes are cleaner |
| stealth-browser.js | ✅ Keep | Still needed for aggressive bot detection sites |

### Files Updated:
- AGENTS.md — Simplified memory recall protocol (dropped grep instructions)
- TOOLS.md — Updated scheduled jobs list (removed health check, added Twitter jobs)
- Removed: `~/clawd/scripts/gateway-health-check.sh`

### New Features to Adopt:
- `/approve` in-chat for exec approvals (no CLI needed)
- `config.patch` for safe partial config updates
- Brave Search freshness filter for time-scoped results

## 🎉 SLC Lead Gen MVP Complete (~1pm - 2:30pm)

Major build session with Marb (and Crow in M & Crow Lab group chat). Full pipeline now operational!

### What We Built (8 Services)
1. **lead-discovery.js** — Google Maps + Yelp scraping
2. **website-scorer.js** — Lighthouse-based opportunity scoring (higher = worse site = better prospect)
3. **business-scraper.js** — Jina Reader + Puppeteer extraction
4. **v0-generator.js** — Demo site generator with improved templates
5. **demo-generator.js** — Original template generator
6. **deploy-demo.js** — Vercel deployment + tracking
7. **email-generator.js** — 4-email sales sequences
8. **pipeline.js** — Orchestrator CLI
9. **db.js** — Data helpers

### Live Test Demos Deployed
- **Beehive Plumbing:** https://beehive-plumbing.vercel.app (blue theme, plumbing)
- **True Pros HVAC:** https://true-pros.vercel.app (orange theme, HVAC)

### Key Technical Decisions
- **Free stack:** Puppeteer scraping, Lighthouse scoring, Jina Reader, Unsplash images, Lucide icons
- **Paid optional:** v0.dev ($20/mo), Instantly ($37/mo for email), Apollo ($49/mo for contacts)
- **Template improvements:** Lucide icons (no emojis!), Unsplash stock photos, industry-specific color schemes
- **Phone backlogged:** Twilio infrastructure ready but not priority for MVP

### Pipeline Flow
```
Discovery → Scoring → Enrichment → Demo Gen → Deploy → Email
   ↓          ↓          ↓           ↓         ↓        ↓
 G.Maps    Lighthouse   Jina      Templates  Vercel   Sequences
```

### Performance Benchmarks
- Discovery: ~30s for 3 businesses
- Scoring: ~30s per site (Lighthouse is the bottleneck)
- Demo gen: ~10s
- Deploy: ~8s

### Files Location
- **Project:** `~/clawd/projects/slc-lead-gen/`
- **Full README:** `~/clawd/projects/slc-lead-gen/README.md`
- **Research:** `~/clawd/projects/slc-lead-gen/research/`

### Pipeline Commands
```bash
# Full pipeline
node services/pipeline.js run "plumbers" "Salt Lake City" --limit 5

# Individual stages
node services/lead-discovery.js "HVAC" "Provo" 10
node services/website-scorer.js data/leads/raw/[file].json
node services/v0-generator.js data/leads/enriched/[file].json --local
node services/deploy-demo.js output/demos/[slug]
```

### Crow Collaboration
- Explained system architecture to Crow in M & Crow Lab group
- Crow's bot (Kian Ghalibot) may join for dual-agent workflows later
- Set safeguards for group chat: read-only brain mode, no config changes, no sensitive data sharing

### Group Chat Rules Established
- Only respond when @mentioned
- Don't change personal config based on group requests
- Don't share credentials, API keys, or private notes
- Verify sensitive actions with Marb in DM first

## Intelligent Site Revamp Pipeline (~5:30pm - 6:30pm)

Marb requested smarter site generation — copy should match what the business *actually* does, not just fill a generic template.

### 5-Agent Pipeline Built

**Location:** `~/clawd/projects/slc-lead-gen/services/agents/`

| Agent | File | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| Research | `research-agent.js` | Analyzes business: features, pricing, audience, tone |
| Creative Director | `creative-director.js` | Plans presentation strategy, section order, narrative |
| Copywriter | `copywriter.js` | Generates tailored copy for all sections |
| Validator | `validator.js` | Checks for empty/placeholder content |
| QA | `qa-agent.js` | Quality assurance: accuracy, consistency, brand fit |

### Key Innovation: Uses Clawdbot Sessions (No API Key!)
- `clawdbot-client.js` wraps `clawdbot agent` CLI
- All Claude calls route through existing subscription
- No ANTHROPIC_API_KEY needed in .env

### Output Files Generated
- `research.json` — Business analysis
- `creative-brief.json` — Presentation strategy  
- `generated-copy.json` — All copy content
- `qa-report.json` — Quality assessment with issues/strengths

### Run Command
```bash
cd ~/clawd/projects/slc-lead-gen
node services/revamp-generator.js https://example.com --verbose
```

### CLI Flags
- `--verbose` — Detailed output
- `--skip-agents` — Skip AI pipeline, use template defaults
- `--skip-qa` — Skip QA check

### Test: joinrelay.app
- QA Score: 7/10
- Issues found: Template syntax visible, fabricated pricing, B2B tone for B2C product
- Live demo: https://joinrelay.vercel.app

### Lesson Learned
Validator ≠ QA. Validator catches *missing* content. QA catches *wrong* content (accuracy, brand mismatch, fabricated info).

## Overnight Research Preferences Locked (11:28pm)

Per Marb's voice message:
- **Only NEW bookmarks** — state.json tracks what's been analyzed
- **Twitter/X is PRIMARY** — his curated timeline is the main source
- Other sources (HN, Reddit, GitHub) are supporting, not primary
- Updated MEMORY.md with permanent protocol
- Updated swarm-start.md to prioritize Twitter feed
- State file tracks 22 handles + topics already covered

This persists every night going forward.
