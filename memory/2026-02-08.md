## Red Rising AI Video Project 🎬
Major new project launched with Marb — faithful book-to-film AI video generation.

### Concept
- Take famous book scenes and make them come to life with AI video gen
- Key differentiator: 100% faithful to source material (anti-Hollywood approach)
- Inspired by PJ Ace's Way of Kings video on Kling 3.0 (18K likes on X)
- First target: Red Rising trilogy by Pierce Brown

### What We Built Tonight
- Downloaded full text of all 3 books (2.4M chars total)
  - Book 1: Red Rising (670K) ✅
  - Book 2: Golden Son (790K) ✅ — BUT the epub was actually Golden Son, PDF was just preview
  - Book 3: Morning Star (955K) ✅
- **Character Bible v2** — 17 characters with exact quotes from Books 1+3
  - Darrow, Eo, Mustang, Sevro, Cassius, Jackal, Augustus, Fitchner, Mickey, Pax
  - NEW: Ragnar, Victra, Aja, Romulus, Dancer, Holiday, Sefi, Roque, Narol, Lilath, Matteo, Lysander
- **Essential Scenes Maps** — Book 1 (12 scenes), Book 3 (14 scenes), Book 2 partial
- **Top 5 Scenes** with shot breakdowns from Book 1
- Scene selected for first test: **Burying Eo Under the Stars**

### Character Reference Images (Kling AI)
- Darrow (Red, pre-carving): Young ~16, red hair, freckles, mining jumpsuit — LOCKED
- Eo: Wild rust-red hair, looking upward, worn red dress — LOCKED
- Key prompt lessons:
  - Avoid "small," "delicate," "petite" — makes characters look like children
  - "Shot on 35mm film" trick dramatically improves photorealism
  - Bump stated age 2-3 years above target to compensate for AI skewing young
  - Content filters block death/violence — use euphemisms

### Kling AI Setup
- Account created: claw-agent@proton.me
- API keys saved: ~/clawd/config/.kling-credentials
- 2.6 test: content filter blocked first attempt, second attempt low quality
- **3.0 requires Pro tier ($25.99/mo)** — Marb upgrading tomorrow
- Key 3.0 features: Multi-Shot, Element Reference, 15s clips, multi-character consistency
- Seedance 2.0 (ByteDance) may be better but China-only for now

### Workflow Established
1. I generate shots autonomously via openclaw browser
2. Screenshot results → send to Marb on Telegram
3. Marb gives creative direction feedback
4. I iterate and regenerate
5. Claw voice narration with exact book passages
6. Assemble in Remotion

### Other Session Work
- **Context overflow debugging** — Root cause: my own oversized tool calls (config.get 3x, JSONL grep)
- Fixed memory files (400K → 180K references)
- Added warning to AGENTS.md about oversized tool calls
- Disabled web_search (no Brave API key)
- Fixed morning report duplicate (compile job delivery set to "none")
- Helped Crow's friend with fetch error (typing TTL + network timeout)

### Proton Mail Access
- Successfully logged into claw-agent@proton.me via openclaw browser
- Retrieved Kling verification code from inbox
- Browser session may still be active

## TODO Tomorrow
1. Marb upgrades to Kling Pro for 3.0
2. Log into Kling on openclaw browser
3. Rewrite burial scene prompts with exact book text
4. Record Claw voice narration
5. Generate first scene shots with 3.0 + Multi-Shot
6. Find full Golden Son text to complete Book 2 bible + scenes
