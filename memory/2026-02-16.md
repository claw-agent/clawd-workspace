## 1:00 AM — Overnight Proactive Session

### Unified `xp` CLI
All proactive ideas were complete, so built something new: a unified CLI that wraps all 8 XPERIENCE systems into one `xp` command.

**What it does:**
- `xp status` — health check of all 8 systems (installed/running/deployed/missing)
- `xp storm` — weather monitoring
- `xp lead` — speed-to-lead with CRM fallback
- `xp quote` — PDF quote generation
- `xp review` — review request campaigns
- `xp crm` — lead database operations
- `xp prospect` — SLC lead gen pipeline
- `xp roi/pricing/dashboard` — open web tools

**Files:**
- `~/clawd/systems/xp` (main script)
- `~/bin/xp` (symlink, in PATH)
- Updated TOOLS.md with quick reference
- Updated PROACTIVE-IDEAS.md

All 8 systems verified working via `xp status`. Color output, error handling, help text.
