# Daily Notes — Feb 16, 2026

## 1:00 AM — Overnight Proactive Session

### Unified `xp` CLI
All proactive ideas were complete, so built something new: a unified CLI that wraps all 8 XPERIENCE systems into one `xp` command.

**What it does:**
- `xp status` — health check of all 8 systems (installed/running/deployed/missing)
- `xp storm` — weather monitoring
- `xp lead` — speed-to-lead with CRM fallback
- `xp quote` — PDF quote generation
- `xp review` — review request campaigns
- `xp crm` — lead database operations
- `xp prospect` — SLC lead gen pipeline
- `xp roi/pricing/dashboard` — open web tools

**Files:**
- `~/clawd/systems/xp` (main script)
- `~/bin/xp` (symlink, in PATH)
- Updated TOOLS.md with quick reference
- Updated PROACTIVE-IDEAS.md

All 8 systems verified working via `xp status`. Color output, error handling, help text.

## 3:00 AM — XPERIENCE Smoke Test (proactive)
Built `~/clawd/scripts/xperience-smoke-test.sh` — validates all 10 XPERIENCE systems:
- Checks scripts exist, deps installed, APIs reachable, CLIs work
- **Fixed:** Speed-to-Lead pointed to wrong filename (speed_to_lead.py → server.py)
- **Fixed:** Demo pipeline path was wrong (scripts/ → projects/slc-lead-gen/)
- **Fixed:** NWS API User-Agent wasn't compliant (added contact email)
- **Installed:** Twilio SDK was missing from .venv — `pip install twilio` (v9.10.1)
- Result: 9/10 pass, 1 cosmetic warning (pricing tool is deploy-only, no local dir)
- Added 3 new proactive ideas: memory consolidation, git automation, customer journey map

## 6:00 AM — Morning Report Compile
Overnight swarm captured 53 items (0 new bookmarks, 17 timeline, 14 GitHub, 22 news). Big themes: steipete → OpenAI (OpenClaw governance risk), Qwen 3.5 release, Chrome DevTools MCP, Opus 4.6 praise.

## 7:00 AM — Morning Report Delivery
Text summary delivered ✅. PDF delivery failed again — path restriction on message tool. PDF exists locally.

## 9:00 AM — System Health Audit
Score 8/10. All 8 cron jobs healthy. Cleaned stale files from memory/ → archive/. Minor: active.md has stale "WAITING" items.

## 5:00 PM — Memory Architecture: Decisions & Lessons Directories
Split lessons-learned.md monolith into individual searchable files:
- `memory/decisions/` — 7 files (one per significant decision)
- `memory/lessons/` — 8 files (one per lesson learned)
- Updated MEMORY.md index with new tiers

## 10:30 PM — Compound Review
Quiet day. No direct Marb interaction. All automated systems ran cleanly. Key: PDF delivery still broken (needs media dir copy or path fix).
