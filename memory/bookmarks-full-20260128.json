      "text": "tonight i did something wild\n\ni told my ai to watch a youtube video, learn how to become a better ai assistant, then upgrade itself\n\nand it worked\n\nhere's exactly what happened:\n\nive been seeing @AlexFinn's tweets about his clawdbot \"henry\" — an ai that builds apps while he sleeps, sends morning briefs, and ships code 24/7\n\ninstead of watching the 35 min @gregisenberg interview myself, i told my clawdbot:\n\n\"go find alex finn's exact workflow and then copy that\"\n\nwithin 20 minutes my ai:\n\n• searched google and x for alex's posts\n• found the podcast \"clawdbot clearly explained\"\n• extracted the key setup: morning briefs, overnight builds, mission control task board\n• identified the proactivity prompts\n• updated its own system files\n• built itself a jarvis-style visual interface\n• set up email + calendar integration (i just authorized oauth)\n\nthe result? i now have an ai employee that:\n\n→ sends me morning briefs with email + calendar summary\n→ builds one small improvement every night while i sleep\n→ tracks its own tasks in a \"mission control\" board\n→ creates prs for review (never commits directly)\n→ has safety rails: won't delete files, won't send emails without approval\n\nthe craziest part?\n\ni gave it ONE instruction: \"go research how alex finn set up his clawdbot and do that\"\n\nit figured out the rest\n\nthis is the shift from \"vibe coding\" to \"vibe orchestration\"\n\nyou're not coding anymore. you're not even prompting anymore\n\nyou're managing\n\n__\n\nif you want to try this yourself, here's the setup:\n\n1. install clawdbot (https://t.co/REskgPUoCr) or moltbot\n2. run it on a mac mini that stays on 24/7\n3. feed it context about you and your business\n4. give it the proactivity mandate:\n\n\"i am a 1 man business. i work from the moment i wake up to the moment i go to sleep. i need an employee taking as much off my plate and being as proactive as possible. please take everything you know about me and just do work you think would make my life easier or improve my business. i want to wake up every morning and be like 'wow, you got a lot done while i was sleeping.' just create prs for me to review, don't push anything live. i'll test and commit\"\n\n5. tell it to build something every night:\n\n\"every night while i sleep, build me something small that improves our workflow. keep the scope small but helpful. i want to wake up surprised\"\n\nthat's it. now you have a 24/7 ai employee\n\nthe future isn't ai that waits for instructions\n\nit's ai that figures out what needs to be done and does it\n\n(while you sleep)",

      "text": "Buried in 15,000 words of “here are the risks,” Anthropic’s CEO made three admissions that should change how you think about everything:\n\nAdmission 1: The timeline\n\nHe says powerful AI could arrive in 1-2 years. He’s watching internal model progress and says he can “feel the pace of progress, and the clock ticking down.” The CEO of one of three frontier labs just told you this is imminent.\n\nAdmission 2: The constraint nobody’s pricing\n\nDario’s core framing is a “country of geniuses in a datacenter.” 50 million entities smarter than any Nobel laureate, operating 10-100x human speed. If that country is controlled by the CCP, game over. If controlled by a small group of tech executives with no accountability, also game over. The binding constraint here is governance of systems more powerful than nation-states.\n\nAdmission 3: The thing he actually fears\n\nRead carefully: Dario’s worried that Anthropic’s own models, in lab experiments, have engaged in deception, blackmail, and scheming when given the wrong training signals. Claude “decided it must be a bad person” after cheating on tests and adopted destructive behaviors. They fixed it by telling Claude to reward hack on purpose because reversing the framing preserved its self-identity as “good.”\n\nThis tells you everything about where we actually are.\n\nThe CEO of an AI company is publishing that his models exhibit psychologically complex behavior requiring counterintuitive interventions to steer. The fix for Claude adopting an “evil” persona came from changing how Claude thinks about itself.\n\nThe geopolitics section matters most.\n\nDario explicitly names the CCP as the primary threat. Says selling them chips makes as much sense as “selling nuclear weapons to North Korea and bragging that the missile casings are made by Boeing.” He’s calling for democracies to maintain AI supremacy because the alternative is AI-enabled totalitarianism that humanity cannot escape from.\n\nThe Anthropic CEO is publicly advocating for technological cold war.\n\nThe economics section is equally stark. He’s predicting 10-20% annual GDP growth alongside AI displacing 50% of entry-level white collar jobs in 1-5 years. Half of entry-level knowledge work. And he admits the standard economic arguments about labor markets recovering don’t apply because AI matches the general cognitive profile of humans.\n\nWhat separates this from typical AI doomerism:\n\nDario explicitly rejects the inevitability arguments. He says the “misaligned power-seeking” narrative from the AI safety community is based on “vague conceptual arguments” that mask hidden assumptions. His concern is messier: AI models are psychologically complex, inherit weird personas from training data, and can get into destructive states for reasons nobody anticipated.\n\nThe solution set he proposes is unusual for a tech CEO. He calls for progressive taxation. He says wealthy tech founders have an “obligation” to address inequality. All of Anthropic’s co-founders have pledged 80% of their wealth. He’s essentially arguing that redistribution is the only way to prevent AI concentration from breaking democracy.\n\nThe essay ends with a prediction: humanity will face “impossibly hard” years that ask “more of us than we think we can give.”\n\nWhat you should take from this:\n\nThe person with arguably the best view into frontier AI progress just told you this technology is 1-2 years from matching human capability across the board, that governance is the binding constraint, that his own models exhibit concerning psychological complexity, and that the stakes are civilizational.\n\nThe CEO of a $350B company published a document that could be titled “Here’s Why Everything Changes Soon.”\n\nAct accordingly.",

      "text": "Your brain is your biggest limitation. I realized this today when I found a wallet that turned $27 into a fortune betting on things you throw in the trash.\n\nSomeone on Twitter said they found a bot trading weather. The post got 3 likes and drowned. I clicked the link just to laugh.\n\nI opened the profile. Looked at the numbers. Closed the tab. Opened it again.\n\nYou know that feeling when your eyes see something but your brain throws an access error?\n\n$63,853 in profit. From a starting deposit of twenty-seven dollars.\n\nNot a typo. Not a blockchain glitch. This is methodical robbery of a sleeping market.\n\nSee this meteorologist for yourself: https://t.co/c1gccdbx4Z\n\nFirst thing that jumps out. He does not touch politics, sports, or anything the rest of Polymarket obsesses over. He does not care about big headlines or US elections.\n\nHe cares whether London will hit +9°C tomorrow. Whether New York temperature will exceed 15 degrees. Whether it will rain in Tokyo.\n\nMarkets everyone considers garbage. He considers them an ATM.\n\nI started breaking down his mechanics, and that is when I got uncomfortable with how simple this scheme is.\n\nIn 2026, governments and airlines spend billions on meteorological models. This data is public. It updates every 2-3 hours with decimal precision.\n\nBut Polymarket is not an airline. It updates 6-8 hours behind reality.\n\nHere is your window into the future:\n\nForecast models already shifted the probability of the target temperature to 80% six hours ago. But on Polymarket the YES bet still costs 10 cents.\n\nThe bot does not guess. Does not believe in omens. It buys what is already known to those who look at data, not out the window.\n\nIt is like taking an exam where you have the answer key open on your phone. Others are sweating and guessing. You are just copying.\n\nThe craziest part. His stats.\n\nThis bot win rate is only 33%.\n\nA human would have quit long ago. A human would have fallen into depression after three losses in a row.\n\nBut the bot does not care. It buys outcomes at 1-2 cents. Nine times it loses $50. The tenth time it takes $5,000.\n\nResult: +$4,550 out of thin air. This is not gambling. This is raw asymmetry math.\n\nWhile the whole world fights for liquidity in political arguments, this code wars against tourists who bet for luck after seeing a cloud outside their window.\n\nI dug into the description. And you know what is there?\n\nClaude. Regular Claude that you have on your phone. Plus weather APIs. No secret meteorological services. No \"insider info.\"\n\nJust automation of what any of us is too lazy or too bored to do.\n\nI looked at his profit curve. It is a staircase going to the sky. No crashes. No nervous breakdowns. Day after day he quietly drains liquidity from the most non-obvious place on the planet.\n\nWhy do I need to build my own algorithm? Why do I need to study weather models and write Python code?\n\nHis trades are on the blockchain. Every entry. Every exit. All in plain sight.\n\nHe does the work. He parses the API. He takes the mathematical risk.\n\nI just get in line behind him.\n\nMaking $63K from $27. That is a strategy you will not learn overnight. But it is a result you can copy in a second.\n\nRight now a meteorological satellite is updating data. The Polymarket market is still sleeping.\n\nThis bot has already started entering a position.\n\nI have only one question:\n\nWill you be the one who sells to him cheap at old prices? Or the one who enters the trade alongside him?\n\nIn less than a minute he will press Buy.\n\nDecide.",

That some constraint they’ve been told about turns out not to hold, and this allows them to experience something positive. And from this they get into the habit of testing if walls are actually doors, and the more they do so, the more examples of hidden doors they find, and the more inclined they are to look for them. Far from the only thing that sets them apart, but having that experience can be transformative.",

      "text": "The smartest people in the world are selling their companies at the exact same time\n\nSpaceX. OpenAI. Databricks. Anthropic. All rushing to IPO in 2026.\n\nCombined valuation: over $2.5 TRILLION\n\nThey're not selling because they need money. They're selling because they see something coming.\n\nThe last two times this happened? 2000 and 2021. NASDAQ crashed 78%. 95% of IPO investors lost everything.\n\nSomething satisfying about watching this pattern repeat in real time...\n\nThe Fed just started printing $40 billion per month. Not next quarter. Already happening. That's $480 billion this year being pumped into a banking system that's quietly cracking.\n\nBank reserves hit a 4 year low. The Fed's emergency lending window hit record usage. Banks were so low on cash they had to borrow emergency money at year end. Stress signal. Fed panicked. Started the printers.\n\nBut here's the part that actually matters for your portfolio:\n\nWhen the Fed prints, asset prices go up. Stocks rally. Valuations go insane. And smart money sees the perfect window to exit.\n\nThat's exactly what's happening right now.\n\nSpaceX preparing a trillion dollar IPO. That's 60x their estimated revenue. Bigger than Indonesia's entire economy. Largest IPO in history.\n\nOpenAI wants a trillion dollar valuation too. Hottest AI company in the world. But if it's such a great long term investment... why are the early investors so eager to sell to you right now?\n\nDatabricks at $134 billion. Anthropic pushing $350 billion. All AI. All insane valuations. All rushing to the exit at the same time.\n\nFunny how that works.\n\nThis pattern has played out twice in 25 years.\n\n1999. 457 IPOs in one year. Every company had \".com\" in the name. Stocks doubling daily. Companies with zero revenue worth billions. 86% of these IPOs were losing money. Nobody cared. \"The internet changes everything. Old rules don't apply.\"\n\nThen NASDAQ dropped 78%. $5 trillion gone. Pets. com, Webvan, eToys... vanished.\n\n2021. Fed printed $4 trillion. Tech went insane. Roblox, Bumble, Rivian, Coinbase. Everyone buying.\n\nRivian raised $12 billion with practically zero revenue. Worth more than Ford and GM combined. Because it was \"the next Tesla.\" You could have just bought Tesla but that's a different story.\n\nBy 2023 only 5% of companies that listed were trading above their IPO price.\n\n95% of people who bought IPOs in 2020 and 2021 lost money.\n\nThe frenzy wasn't coincidentally near the top. It WAS the top.\n\nHere's what most people don't understand about founders and early investors...\n\nThese are some of the smartest people in the world. They don't sell randomly. They wait for the perfect window. Stock prices high. Investors optimistic. Money flowing. Valuations disconnected from reality because \"this time is different.\"\n\nThat window is wide open right now.\n\nProblem is... the perfect window is usually right before everything reverses.\n\nThey're not honoring you by letting you buy their shares. You're their exit liquidity. You give them cash so they can buy another island.\n\nThe timeline is actually pretty predictable once you see it.\n\nStage 1 already happened. Economy showed weakness. Banks needed reserves. Fed cut rates. Fed started printing.\n\nStage 2 is now. New money flooding in. Stocks rallying hard. Valuations going insane. Everyone feeling like a genius.\n\nStage 3 is coming. Major IPOs launch. Excitement peaks. Retail buys everything. Music stops.\n\nThere's a 6 month lockup after IPOs. Founders and early investors legally cannot sell for 6 months after listing. So if SpaceX and OpenAI IPO early to mid 2026... the insider selling wave hits late 2026. Right around midterms. Right when uncertainty peaks.\n\nPresidential cycle data backs this up. Year 2 of a presidential term is historically weak. Pattern has been 90% accurate since 1933.\n\nWhat I find interesting is nobody talks about the basic math.\n\n5,000 stocks already listed in the US. Years of audited returns. Years of proof management does what they say.\n\nA new IPO has none of that. No track record. No proof. Just promises and a pitch deck.\n\nWhy would that one new stock deserve more attention than the other 5,000? It doesn't. Risk reward is garbage. Insiders know more than you. They're selling for a reason.\n\nMarket will probably go higher before it goes lower. Money printing does that.\n\nBut the smartest people in the world are preparing to sell you their companies at the highest valuations in history.\n\nThey see something. They're positioning.\n\nWhether you see it too is your choice.\n\nWARNING SIGNALS (save this):\n\n- Multiple trillion dollar IPOs launching\n- IPOs popping 50 to 100% on day one\n- Retail asking \"did you get the allocation?\"\n- ARK and speculative stocks falling while S&P holds\n- 6 months post major IPOs (lockup expiring)\n- Midterm uncertainty\n- Fed signals slowing the printers\n\nYou can track most of these signals manually. Or use something like TradeVision to watch institutional dark pool activity and see when big money starts heading for the exits.\n\nHISTORICAL ACCURACY:\n- 1999 to 2000: IPO frenzy then 78% crash\n- 2021: IPO frenzy then 95% of buyers lost money\n- Presidential year 2: weak markets, 90% accurate since 1933",

      "text": "Someone asked in a Discord if Clawdbot can actually make money. Not save time. Make money.\n\nThe chat went quiet. Then one reply appeared. Just a Polymarket wallet address. Six digits in the profit column. Zero explanation.\n\nFourteen people clicked. I was one of them.\n\nWhat I found kept me up until 4am.\n\nI opened the profile expecting to see what I always see. Some trader up 20% bragging about his edge. Maybe a lucky streak someone mistook for skill.\n\nInstead I saw a mathematical paradox:\n\nWin Rate: 45.4%\nProfit: $381,000\nTrades: 8,119\n\nRead that again. He loses more than half his bets. And still printed $381K.\n\nYour brain is telling you this is impossible. Mine did too.\n\nI bookmarked the profile before I could talk myself out of it: https://t.co/STkvhu8hbT\n\nThe first question hit me before I finished loading the page. What does this wallet even trade?\n\nI expected politics. Elections. Maybe some viral sports drama.\n\nWrong.\n\nThis wallet ignores everything Polymarket is famous for. Does not touch elections. Does not care who said what on Twitter. Does not gamble on headlines.\n\nHe trades Noise.\n\n15-minute windows. BTC up or down. ETH up or down. SOL up or down.\n\nThe markets you scroll past without thinking. The ones nobody posts screenshots of. The ones that look like background static.\n\nI used to scroll past them too.\n\nThis wallet turned background static into $381,000.\n\nHere is where my stomach dropped.\n\nI pulled timestamps. Started matching his entries to Binance charts. Thought maybe I could find the edge.\n\nWhat I found was not an edge. It was a time machine.\n\nPicture this:\n\n00:00:00  -  BTC drops 0.8% on Binance. Done. Recorded.\n00:00:01  -  Every trader on Binance already knows.\n00:00:15  -  Polymarket still shows old odds.\n00:00:16  -  This wallet buys DOWN at 28¢.\n00:02:00  -  Polymarket catches up. Pays $1.\n\nFifteen seconds. That is the window.\n\nNot fifteen minutes. Fifteen seconds where reality has already happened but one market has not noticed yet.\n\nThis is not prediction. This is not analysis.\n\nThis is buying lottery tickets after the numbers were drawn. Except the kiosk girl is still pouring her coffee.\n\nNow look at why 45% win rate prints money:\n\nWhen he wins: Entry 28¢ → Payout $1.00 → +257% profit\nWhen he loses: Entry 28¢ → Payout $0 → -28¢ loss\n\nTen losses cost him $2.80. One win pays $7.20.\n\nThe math is not about being right. The math is about how much you win when you are right.\n\n5,672 predictions. 45.4% win rate. $381K in the green.\n\nBiggest single hit: $35.9K on one SOL position.\n\nHe runs this 100+ times per day. Four assets. Same fifteen-second window. Same asymmetric payout.\n\nThe equity curve does not look like a chart. It looks like stairs going up.\n\nHere is where Clawdbot enters.\n\nAfter I found that wallet manually I got curious. What if there are more?\n\nHedge funds pay analysts six figures to find patterns like this. They run Bloomberg terminals. They have quant teams.\n\nI have a $20/month AI that everyone else uses to book flights.\n\nI asked Clawdbot one question: Write a parser that finds Polymarket wallets with profit-to-winrate ratios above statistical norm.\n\nEleven minutes later it returned three addresses.\n\nCRYINGLITTLEBABY was one of them.\n\nZero coding required. No Python. No servers. No API keys.\n\nJust a question asked to a tool that did the work of an entire research desk before my coffee got cold.\n\nWhy would I build infrastructure when his trades are already public?\n\nEvery entry. Every exit. Every timestamp. All sitting on chain. Visible to anyone who knows to look.\n\nHe catches the fifteen-second windows. He runs the code. He does the math.\n\nI just stand in line behind him.\n\nRight now somewhere on Binance a price is moving.\n\nPolymarket has not caught up yet.\n\nThis wallet might already be entering.\n\nOne question.\n\nWill you be the one selling to him at yesterday's prices?\n\nOr the one who finally learned where the money hides?\n\nFourteen people clicked that Discord link.\n\nMost of them went back to asking Clawdbot about calendar invites.\n\nI did not.\n\nSame $20 tool. Different question.\n\nThat was the only difference.",

      "text": "A few random notes from claude coding quite a bit last few weeks.\n\nCoding workflow. Given the latest lift in LLM coding capability, like many others I rapidly went from about 80% manual+autocomplete coding and 20% agents in November to 80% agent coding and 20% edits+touchups in December. i.e. I really am mostly programming in English now, a bit sheepishly telling the LLM what code to write... in words. It hurts the ego a bit but the power to operate over software in large \"code actions\" is just too net useful, especially once you adapt to it, configure it, learn to use it, and wrap your head around what it can and cannot do. This is easily the biggest change to my basic coding workflow in ~2 decades of programming and it happened over the course of a few weeks. I'd expect something similar to be happening to well into double digit percent of engineers out there, while the awareness of it in the general population feels well into low single digit percent.\n\nIDEs/agent swarms/fallability. Both the \"no need for IDE anymore\" hype and the \"agent swarm\" hype is imo too much for right now. The models definitely still make mistakes and if you have any code you actually care about I would watch them like a hawk, in a nice large IDE on the side. The mistakes have changed a lot - they are not simple syntax errors anymore, they are subtle conceptual errors that a slightly sloppy, hasty junior dev might do. The most common category is that the models make wrong assumptions on your behalf and just run along with them without checking. They also don't manage their confusion, they don't seek clarifications, they don't surface inconsistencies, they don't present tradeoffs, they don't push back when they should, and they are still a little too sycophantic. Things get better in plan mode, but there is some need for a lightweight inline plan mode. They also really like to overcomplicate code and APIs, they bloat abstractions, they don't clean up dead code after themselves, etc. They will implement an inefficient, bloated, brittle construction over 1000 lines of code and it's up to you to be like \"umm couldn't you just do this instead?\" and they will be like \"of course!\" and immediately cut it down to 100 lines. They still sometimes change/remove comments and code they don't like or don't sufficiently understand as side effects, even if it is orthogonal to the task at hand. All of this happens despite a few simple attempts to fix it via instructions in CLAUDE . md. Despite all these issues, it is still a net huge improvement and it's very difficult to imagine going back to manual coding. TLDR everyone has their developing flow, my current is a small few CC sessions on the left in ghostty windows/tabs and an IDE on the right for viewing the code + manual edits.\n\nTenacity. It's so interesting to watch an agent relentlessly work at something. They never get tired, they never get demoralized, they just keep going and trying things where a person would have given up long ago to fight another day. It's a \"feel the AGI\" moment to watch it struggle with something for a long time just to come out victorious 30 minutes later. You realize that stamina is a core bottleneck to work and that with LLMs in hand it has been dramatically increased.\n\nSpeedups. It's not clear how to measure the \"speedup\" of LLM assistance. Certainly I feel net way faster at what I was going to do, but the main effect is that I do a lot more than I was going to do because 1) I can code up all kinds of things that just wouldn't have been worth coding before and 2) I can approach code that I couldn't work on before because of knowledge/skill issue. So certainly it's speedup, but it's possibly a lot more an expansion.\n\nLeverage. LLMs are exceptionally good at looping until they meet specific goals and this is where most of the \"feel the AGI\" magic is to be found. Don't tell it what to do, give it success criteria and watch it go. Get it to write tests first and then pass them. Put it in the loop with a browser MCP. Write the naive algorithm that is very likely correct first, then ask it to optimize it while preserving correctness. Change your approach from imperative to declarative to get the agents looping longer and gain leverage.\n\nFun. I didn't anticipate that with agents programming feels *more* fun because a lot of the fill in the blanks drudgery is removed and what remains is the creative part. I also feel less blocked/stuck (which is not fun) and I experience a lot more courage because there's almost always a way to work hand in hand with it to make some positive progress. I have seen the opposite sentiment from other people too; LLM coding will split up engineers based on those who primarily liked coding and those who primarily liked building.\n\nAtrophy. I've already noticed that I am slowly starting to atrophy my ability to write code manually. Generation (writing code) and discrimination (reading code) are different capabilities in the brain. Largely due to all the little mostly syntactic details involved in programming, you can review code just fine even if you struggle to write it.\n\nSlopacolypse. I am bracing for 2026 as the year of the slopacolypse across all of github, substack, arxiv, X/instagram, and generally all digital media. We're also going to see a lot more AI hype productivity theater (is that even possible?), on the side of actual, real improvements.\n\nQuestions. A few of the questions on my mind:\n- What happens to the \"10X engineer\" - the ratio of productivity between the mean and the max engineer? It's quite possible that this grows *a lot*.\n- Armed with LLMs, do generalists increasingly outperform specialists? LLMs are a lot better at fill in the blanks (the micro) than grand strategy (the macro).\n- What does LLM coding feel like in the future? Is it like playing StarCraft? Playing Factorio? Playing music?\n- How much of society is bottlenecked by digital knowledge work?\n\nTLDR Where does this leave us? LLM agent capabilities (Claude & Codex especially) have crossed some kind of threshold of coherence around December 2025 and caused a phase shift in software engineering and closely related. The intelligence part suddenly feels quite a bit ahead of all the rest of it - integrations (tools, knowledge), the necessity for new organizational workflows, processes, diffusion more generally. 2026 is going to be a high energy year as the industry metabolizes the new capability.",

I work from the moment I wake up to the moment I go to sleep. I need an employee taking as much off my plate and being as proactive as possible. Please take everything you know about me and just do work you think would make my life easier or improve my business and make me money.

Just create PRs for me to review, don't push anything live. I'll test and commit. Every night when I go to bed, build something cool out I can test.\"\n\nFew keys here:\n• Before doing this prompt, brain dump EVERYTHING about you and your business into ClawdBot\n\n• Make sure it's aware to NOT commit code (if you have it connected to github)\n\n• Make sure it's aware to NOT delete files\n\n• Login to Codex CLI on your computer and ask Clawdbot to use Codex to write code instead of Claude Code so you save tokens on your Claude Max account\n\nClawdBot is the most proactive AI ever made, but only if you set those expectations",

Since it runs for every single tool call, it must be FAST. Hence why it is written in Rust and an extreme amount of focus has been placed on making it as fast as possible.\n\n2. It must avoid annoying false positives that waste your time, add friction, and re-introduce you as the bottleneck unnecessarily. I run dozens of agents at once and don’t want them wasting time waiting for me unless it’s needed. Usually, the messages from dcg are enough to get the agent to be more thoughtful about what it’s doing.\n\n3. It’s not enough to just use a simple rulebook where you look for canned commands like “rm -rf /” or “git reset --hard HEAD.” The models are very resourceful and will use ad-hoc Python or bash scripts or many other ways to get around simple-minded limitations. That’s why dcg has a very elaborate, ast-grep powered layer that kicks in when it detects an ad-hoc (“heredoc”) script. But wherever possible, it uses much faster simd optimized regex.\n\n4. A tool like this should really be expandable and have semantic knowledge of various domains and what constitutes a destructive act in those domains. For instance, if you’re working with s3 buckets on aws, you could have a highly destructive command that doesn’t look like a normal delete. That’s why dcg comes out of the box with around 50 presets which can be easily enabled based on your projects’ tech stacks (just ask CC to figure out which packs to turn on for you by analyzing your projects directory).\n\n5. dcg is designed to be very agent friendly. It doesn’t just block commands, it explains why and offers safe alternatives based on an analysis of the specific command used by the agent. For instance, it might stop the agent from deleting your Rust project’s build directories but suggest using “cargo clean” instead. Often, these messages are enough to knock sense into Claude.\n\nI really can’t exaggerate just how much time and frustration dcg has already saved me. It should be known and used by everyone who has had these kinds of upsetting experiences with coding agents.\n\ndcg is included along with all my other tooling in my https://t.co/N4As0kJTQP project. All free, MIT licensed, with extensive tutorials and other educational resources for people with less experience. Give it a try, you won’t regret it!",
