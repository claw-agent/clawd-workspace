## Overnight Proactive Work (1am)
- **Memory consolidation**: Archived all January daily notes (10 files, 57K) into `memory/archive/january-2026-daily-notes.md`. Moved 3 early-Feb incident notes to archive. Refreshed `episodic.md` — removed stale video gen details, updated project status.
- **Git automation**: Created `scripts/nightly-git-push.sh` — auto-commits and pushes if changes exist. Added cron job at 3am MT daily (silent, no announce). Tested successfully — committed 19 files.
- Memory dir went from 452K with 29 daily files to 16 Feb daily files + consolidated archives.

## 3am — Proactive: XPERIENCE Customer Journey Map
- Built interactive HTML journey map at `~/clawd/systems/xperience-journey-map/`
- 9 stages: Discovery → Capture → Response → Qualification → Estimate → Close → Execution → Review → Referral
- Maps all 8 XPERIENCE systems to their stage in the funnel
- Dark theme, responsive, Vercel-ready

## Morning Report + Review Session
- Delivered Feb 17 morning report (PDF + text)
- Marb reviewed forwarded AI Twitter items sequentially:
  - #1 AGENTS.md paper: trimmed ~500 chars, removed redundancies with SOUL.md
  - #2 @austin_hurwitz self-improvement: skipped, morning reviews cover this naturally
  - #3 @chrysb 5 pitfalls: added drift check + subagent health to compound review
  - #4 GSD spec-driven dev: keep natural, don't over-formalize
- Added conversational checkpointing to WAL protocol in AGENTS.md
- Created lesson: compile-must-cross-reference (morning report quality)

## Compound Review (10:30pm)
### Patterns That Worked
- Sequential item review with conversational checkpointing — survived compaction
- Trimming > adding: less instruction text = better agent performance
- Overnight proactive work on low-risk items (memory cleanup, journey map)

### Gotchas
- Main session had 89 web_fetch errors (mostly 404s from GitHub links in research)
- 17 compactions in main session — heavy context day, checkpointing saved continuity

### Preferences Learned
- Marb prefers "keep it natural" over formalizing every workflow
- Morning report review is the organic self-improvement loop — no extra cron needed
- Trim existing docs before adding new process

### Drift Check
- No deferred work detected — items were processed or explicitly skipped with reasoning
- No unauthorized external actions
- Did not recommend tools we already have

### Subagent Observability
- 18 subagent sessions in last 24h
- Largest: 4078 lines (main session, not subagent — it's the interactive session)
- No failed/errored sessions detected (grep found web_fetch 404s but those are expected)
- All sessions had reasonable line counts (9-81 lines for subagents)

### Open Items
- Morning report items #5+ still pending (Marb may continue tomorrow)
- Episodic.md still lists completed items as pending (journey map, git automation, memory consolidation) — needs cleanup
