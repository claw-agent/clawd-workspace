## Overnight Proactive Work (1am)
- **Memory consolidation**: Archived all January daily notes (10 files, 57K) into `memory/archive/january-2026-daily-notes.md`. Moved 3 early-Feb incident notes to archive. Refreshed `episodic.md` — removed stale video gen details, updated project status.
- **Git automation**: Created `scripts/nightly-git-push.sh` — auto-commits and pushes if changes exist. Added cron job at 3am MT daily (silent, no announce). Tested successfully — committed 19 files.
- Memory dir went from 452K with 29 daily files to 16 Feb daily files + consolidated archives.
