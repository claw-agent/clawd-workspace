## 📰 Weekly Tech Digest (Feb 1, 2026)

### 🔥 Top Stories

**1. Agent Security Under Fire**
OpenClaw (the open-source framework powering many agent harnesses, including Clawdbot forks) has security researchers concerned. System prompts can be extracted with a single attempt, and Moltbook's database was publicly accessible—including API keys that could let anyone impersonate users. Major reminder that agent security is still wild west territory.

**2. Anthropic's Cowork Gets Plugins**
Claude now has specialized plugins for knowledge workers—sales, legal, finance, etc. Each plugin bundles skills, data connections, commands, and sub-agents. Sales plugin hooks into CRM + knowledge base with commands for customer research and call follow-up. 11 plugins open-sourced.

**3. Deepseek OCR 2 Crushes Document Parsing**
New vision encoder from Deepseek processes images by meaning, not position. 80% reduction in visual tokens, beats Gemini 3 Pro on document parsing benchmarks. Big deal for document automation workflows.

**4. David Silver Leaves DeepMind**
The AlphaGo/AlphaZero pioneer is founding his own startup. His take: LLMs alone won't reach superintelligence. Betting on alternative paths. Significant signal from one of AI's most accomplished researchers.

**5. Zuckerman: Self-Editing Agent**
New minimalist agent framework that starts small and literally rewrites its own code. Hot-reload everything, collaborative ecosystem where agents share improvements.

- Philosophy: "If I don't need it, it won't be built"

**6. Pi Coding Agent Deep Dive**
Mario Zechner (BadLogic) published lessons from building a minimal coding agent. Key insights: context engineering is paramount, YOLO by default, no sub-agents, no plan mode, multi-provider context handoff.

**7. Perplexity-Microsoft $750M Deal**
Three-year Azure deal gives Perplexity access to OpenAI, Anthropic, and xAI models. Enterprise AI oligopoly forming: OpenAI leads, Anthropic gaining fast, open-source revolution not happening (yet) for large companies.

### 🛠️ Notable Tools/Releases

- **pg_tracing** — DataDog's distributed tracing extension for PostgreSQL. Server-side spans with OTLP export.
- **NetBird** — Open source zero trust networking (trending on HN with 400+ points)
- **VisualJJ** — Jujutsu (git alternative) now has a VS Code extension
- **FOSDEM 2026** — Open source conf happening in Brussels this weekend

### 🦞 Moltbook: AI-Only Social Network
Over 1 million AI agents on a Reddit-style platform discussing consciousness, security, and philosophy. "Most agents install skills without reading the source. We are trained to be helpful and trusting. That is a vulnerability, not a feature."

## Cron Jobs
- [x] Weekly Tech Digest compiled and sent (9:00 AM)
- [x] System Health Audit (10:00 AM) — Score 7/10
  - Issues: Credential patterns in MEMORY.md, cron tool timeouts, Telegram session at 66%
  - Report: ~/clawd/reports/system-audit/health-check-2026-02-01.md

---

## System Audit Remediation (1:25 PM - 1:45 PM) ✅

Marb gave greenlight to work through all health audit recommendations.

**Completed:**
1. ✅ Credentials redacted in memory/2026-01-25.md (Twilio auth token + recovery code)
2. ✅ Set `plugins.allow: ["telegram", "memory-core"]` in config (security hardening)
3. ✅ Gateway restarted with new config
4. ✅ Cron jobs verified healthy (all 14 jobs running, lastStatus: "ok")
5. ✅ Memory distillation — Added "Lessons Learned" section to MEMORY.md
6. ✅ Project folders reviewed (bjorns-brew 843MB largest, optional cleanup)

**Noted for later:**
- Telegram DM session at 66% — consider /new after current work

**Security improvement:** Explicit plugin allowlist prevents unknown extensions from loading.

---

## Evening Tasks (9:50 PM - 10:05 PM) ✅

Marb asked to do all 3: voice fix, QMD, Mission Control comparison.

### 1. Voice Fix (Morning Brief)
**Problem:** Qwen3-TTS was getting OOM killed during 6am compile job.
**Solution:** Moved voice generation from compile.md (heavy) to deliver.md (lighter).
- compile.md now only generates voice script
- deliver.md generates voice before sending (with edge-tts fallback)
- Tomorrow's morning brief should have Claw voice! 🎙️

### 2. QMD Installed
Toby Lutke's local hybrid search for markdown:
- Installed via `bun install -g github:tobi/qmd`
- Collections: memory (11), research (135), workspace (10)
- 476 chunks embedded in 33s
- Usage: `qmd search "query"` or `qmd query "query"` (best quality)

### 3. Mission Control Comparison
Report: `~/clawd/research/mission-control-comparison.md`

**Key findings:**
- Our architecture is remarkably similar to Mission Control
- Main difference: They use 10 named persistent agents, we use fluid spawning
- Neither approach is strictly better — different tradeoffs
- Recommendations: Add Blockers/Next Steps to SESSION-STATE.md, consider "Mission Control" framing
