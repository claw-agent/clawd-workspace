# Active Context

## Current Focus
Reviewing morning briefs with Marb. **Feb 8 brief DONE, Feb 9 brief NEXT.**

## Just Completed
- OpenClaw updated to 2026.2.9
- SOUL.md updated with personality tweaks
- Shannon pentester installed (~/clawd/tools/shannon)
- Firecrawl SDK installed (no API key yet)
- Marketing playbook agent created (~/clawd/agents/marketing-playbook.md)
- Research: firecrawl-evaluation.md, gateway-watchdog.md

## Next Up
- Go through Feb 9 morning brief with Marb
- Reports at: ~/clawd/reports/morning-2026-02-09/

## Recent Decisions
- Our WAL protocol + native compaction fix = complementary, keep both
- Bird CLI: Safari cookies only (not Chrome) — documented
- Heretic (model uncensoring) bookmarked for future, not needed now
- Gateway watchdog: medium priority, build if we see unexplained silence
