# Active Context — Feb 11, 2026

## Current Focus
**Pipeline integration** — merge v2 template patterns into the lead gen pipeline and run a full XPERIENCE generation.

## Priority Queue
1. Integrate v2 design language into `service-business.html` template (keep {{variable}} hooks)
2. Run full 5-agent pipeline for XPERIENCE Roofing → deploy to Vercel
3. Read Anthropic 33-page skills guide, compare against our skills
4. Git push to claw-agent/clawd-workspace
5. Preview v1 vs v2 side-by-side when Marb is at Mac mini

## Open Items
- **"13 hype-free lessons"** — still unfound, deprioritize
- **OpenClaw version discrepancy** — npm shows 2026.2.6-3 vs 2026.2.9 available
- **Red Rising video** — Kling 3.0 access unlocked, Darrow reference locked, next: Eo + first video test

## Recent Decisions (Feb 10)
- ✅ Adopt compound engineering learning capture (AGENTS.md updated)
- ✅ Build v2 template with full design language spec
- ✅ Stagger subagent spawns ~30s (undici TLS bug workaround)
- 👀 Watch: Monty, Chrome native browsing (too early to adopt)
- ❌ Skip: Dexter (wrong domain)
