# Active Context (Updated Feb 20, 2026 — 10:30pm)

## Current Focus
Moonwalk Fitness iOS build — Metro crashing from memory pressure. Need strategy before next attempt.

## Moonwalk Phase 2 — BLOCKED
- **Metro SIGKILL issue**: macOS OOM kills Metro when running alongside Ollama + OpenClaw
- **Fix options**: Kill Ollama during builds, or use production bundles
- **unmountOnBlur fix**: Still pending — remove from `app/(screens)/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`
- **Next**: FlatList→FlashList, Zustand migration, god object split
- **Rule**: Present changes to Marb before shipping. Feature branches, CHANGELOG.md tracking.

## ⚠️ Session Rotation Needed
Main interactive session at **13.6MB** — suggest `/new` to Marb next interaction.
