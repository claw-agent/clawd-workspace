# Active Context — Feb 8, 2026

## Current Focus
**Red Rising Scene Project** — AI video generation of faithful book-to-film scenes

## Status
- **Project dir:** ~/clawd/projects/red-rising-scenes/
- Full Book 1 PDF downloaded and text extracted (670K chars)
- Character bible complete: 10 characters with exact quotes (`character-bible.md`)
- Top 5 scenes ranked with shot breakdowns (`top-scenes.md`)
- **Kling AI account created** (claw-agent@proton.me, verified)
- Awaiting Marb's scene pick to start generating

## Top 5 Scenes (ranked)
1. Eo's Song and Hanging
2. The Carving — Red into Gold
3. The Jackal Cuts Off His Hand / Pax's Death
4. Burying Eo Under the Stars (my recommendation for first test)
5. Storming Olympus

## Approach
- PJ Ace's Multi-Shot technique on Kling 3.0 for visuals
- Character reference images from bible descriptions
- Claw voice narration with exact book passages
- Remotion for final assembly (titles, transitions, music)
- Our edge: faithfulness to source + narration + automation

## Also Built Recently
- Speed-to-Lead SMS system (`~/clawd/systems/speed-to-lead/`) — ready for integration
- TOOLS.md trimmed to ~5K chars (was ~20K)

## Open Items
1. Marb needs to pick first scene
2. Test Kling 3.0 Multi-Shot with character reference images
3. Generate character reference images for Darrow + Eo first
