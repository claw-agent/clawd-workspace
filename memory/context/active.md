# Active Context

## Current Focus
**Red Rising AI Video** — primary creative project. Kling 3.0 Pro unlocked. Character references in progress (Darrow locked, Eo next). 37 shots scripted across 5 scenes. Next: generate Eo reference, first video test.

## Open Items
- [ ] Generate Eo reference image (Kling 3.0)
- [ ] First video test with Kling 3.0 Multi-Shot
- [ ] YELO deck: Quick Polish pass (dark palette → add imagery, trust signals)
- [ ] Feb 9 morning brief — Marb hasn't reviewed yet
- [ ] Firecrawl: get API key from Marb, integrate with lead gen
- [ ] Shannon: point at a Vercel deployment for first pentest
- [ ] Claw voice OOM on long text — chunked script has quote-escaping bug

## Recently Completed
- Backup system: nightly git push + setup script for new machines
- Git history cleaned (node_modules, epub removed from history)
- Book 2 (Golden Son) full text extracted, character bible complete for all 3 books
- All 5 top Book 1 scenes scripted with Kling prompts (37 shots)
- Shannon pentester installed
- Firecrawl SDK installed
- Marketing playbook agent created

## Recent Decisions
- Quick Polish for YELO deck first, Full Redesign after
- Kling prompt strategy: simplify prompts, avoid "small/delicate", "shot on 35mm film" for realism
- .gitignore-first policy for any new repos
