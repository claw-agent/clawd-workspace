# Active Context (Scratchpad)
*Updated: 2026-02-18 (compound review)*

## Current Focus
Morning report review with Marb — paused at item #4. Pending #5+ when Marb continues.

## Open Items
- Morning report items #5+ still queued
- Episodic.md needs stale items cleaned (journey map, git automation now done)
- Skill description routing updates (ongoing)
- Convert remaining workflows to proper skills (ongoing)

## Recent Decisions
- Trim AGENTS.md rather than add process → `memory/decisions/agents-md-trim-over-formalize.md`
- Keep workflows natural, don't over-formalize → `memory/decisions/natural-workflow-over-formalization.md`

## Recent Lessons
- Conversational checkpointing survives compaction → `memory/lessons/conversational-checkpointing-survives-compaction.md`
- Compile must cross-reference sources → `memory/lessons/compile-must-cross-reference.md`
