# Active Context — Last Updated Feb 16, 2026

## Current State
Quiet Monday. No direct Marb interaction. All automated systems healthy.

## Open Items
- **PDF delivery broken** — morning report PDF can't be sent via message tool (path restriction). Needs: copy to `~/.openclaw/media/` before send, or base64 inline (too large). Fix in morning-report-deliver skill.
- **active.md had stale items** — cleaned up now
- **Chrome DevTools MCP** — flagged in morning report as action item to integrate
- **Chatterbox TTS** — evaluate as potential upgrade to edge-tts fallback
- Continue skill description routing updates (2-3 per day)
- Get Midjourney OAuth from Marb (still pending)

## Recent Completions
- Memory architecture: decisions/ and lessons/ directories (searchable individual files)
- XPERIENCE `xp` unified CLI + smoke test script
- System health audit: 8/10, cleaned stale files
- Overnight research swarm running reliably (53 items tonight)
