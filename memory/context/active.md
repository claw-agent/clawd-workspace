# Active Context — Feb 12, 2026

## CURRENT TASK (from Marb)
OpenAI agent primitives improvement plan. Execute in this order:
1. Slim down AGENTS.md + TOOLS.md — move templates/workflows into skills (token savings)
2. Add routing logic to skill descriptions — "use when / don't use when" + negative examples
3. Convert top workflows to skills — morning report, site gen, research swarms
4. Standardize artifact output directory
