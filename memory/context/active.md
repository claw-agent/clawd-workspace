# Active Context — Feb 11, 2026 (Early AM)

## Morning Deliverables for Marb
1. **Seedance/video gen research** — Written to ~/clawd/research/seedance-video-gen.md
   - seedance.ai is NOT the real model (third-party wrapper)
   - Real Seedance 2 → Dreamina (CapCut) or Jimeng AI (Chinese)
   - Need to sign up for Dreamina and test
   - Also mapped Veo 3.1, Grok Imagine Video, Hailuo as alternatives
   - Multi-tool pipeline strategy for Red Rising
2. **Integrate design language into site gen pipeline** — Feed improvements into existing agent pipeline, regenerate with full process
3. V2 template lesson: don't bypass pipeline, improve the pipeline itself

## What Happened Feb 10
- Morning report deep review (voice notes)
- Research: Monty (watch), Compound Engineering (adopted), Dexter (skip), Chrome browsing (watch), Crawshaw article (summarized)
- Built: service-business-v2.html (UI upgrade), roofing operations audit (9-domain)
- **Lesson learned:** One-shotting a template bypasses the proven agent pipeline. Feed improvements INTO the pipeline instead.
- Updated AGENTS.md: compound engineering cycle, stagger spawns warning, tool/skill improvement rule
- Subagent crash: undici@7.21.0 TLS bug (8 crashes), stagger spawns ~30s
- Created ~/clawd/resources/web-design/ shared design system
- Deployed XPERIENCE preview to Vercel (rough v2, needs pipeline regeneration)

## Marb's State
- Had anesthesia on Feb 10, groggy but engaged
- Going to bed ~1:30am, excited about video gen / Seedance
- Loves new blunt/direct communication style

## Still Pending
- Git push to claw-agent/clawd-workspace
- OpenClaw version discrepancy (npm 2026.2.6-3 vs 2026.2.9)
- Anthropic 33-page skills guide — read in full
- "13 hype-free lessons" Reddit post — never found
- Sign up for Dreamina and test Seedance 2
- Test fal.ai Veo 3.1 and Grok Imagine Video
