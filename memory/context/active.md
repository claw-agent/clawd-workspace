# Active Context (Last updated: Feb 13, 2026 ~11:55pm)

## Current Focus: Red Rising AI Video Project
- Marb actively working on video gen in his Chrome browser
- Generated Darrow & Cassius character refs in Midjourney
- Tried Kling multi-shot — results were bad ("incredible shitty")
- ChatCut Seedance 2.0: 3 attempts, all failed silently. Platform is overwhelmed post-public-launch.
- Marb got ChatCut to generate manually (was fast for him) but export broken

## AI Video Gen Playbook Created
- `~/clawd/research/ai-video-gen-playbook.md` — sent to Marb
- Key learnings: image-to-video is the meta, we've been over-prompting, need timestamped action beats for Kling, post-production (Topaz + DaVinci) is mandatory
- Top creators: @OrctonAI, @Strength04_X, @Legoman_Grizu

## Supplement Discussion
- Marb's stack: Thorne AM/PM multi, 12.5g creatine, 10K IU vitamin D, omega-3, glutathione spray
- Recommended adding: K2 (pairs with high-dose D3), mag L-threonate for sleep

## Doubao.com (Dead End)
- Requires +86 phone number, VPN doesn't help — auth wall not geo-block
- Research: `~/clawd/research/doubao-seedance-access.md`

## ChatCut Monitor Cron
- Job ID: `7eb4b27a-4532-4da7-8375-8c727964a2b8` — currently ENABLED but pointed at stale project
- Should probably disable since Marb is doing it manually now

## Ongoing
- Morning report system (PDF + text, no voice)
- Skill description routing updates
- XPERIENCE pricing tool deployed, awaiting feedback
