## Just Completed
- OpenClaw pnpm updated to 2026.2.14 (but dual-install issue: /opt/homebrew/bin still has 2026.2.6-3, pnpm has 2026.2.14 — need to resolve)
- Weekly tech digest cron DISABLED (redundant with daily reports)
- WebMCP + Agent Lightning researched → ~/clawd/research/webmcp-agent-lightning.md
