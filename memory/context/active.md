# Active Context (Last updated: Feb 13, 2026 10:30pm)

## Current State
- Relatively quiet day — system running smoothly
- Marb manually generating Seedance 2.0 video in Chrome (Round 2, refined prompt)
- All automated systems healthy: overnight swarm, morning report, health audit

## Recent Conversations
- Supplement stack analysis (Marb takes Thorne AM/PM, creatine, D3, omega-3, glutathione)
- Red Rising Seedance 2.0 prompt refinement (futuristic attire, razors, more extravagant)

## Open Items
1. Seedance 2.0 Round 2 — Marb trying manually, may need prompt tweaks
2. OpenClaw upgrade to 2026.2.12 — security fixes, not yet applied
3. Agent primitives backlog: persistent shells, permission scoping, eval framework
4. XPERIENCE proactive: ops dashboard, quote PDF gen, lead CRM
5. Skill description routing — continue 2-3/day updates

## Key Learnings This Week
- ChatCut can't be automated (auth + client-side) — prompt crafting is our role
- Long-polling subagents waste context — avoid for indeterminate waits
- System file trimming (48K→15K) was biggest context win
- WAL protocol prevents post-compaction amnesia
