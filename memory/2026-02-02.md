# 2026-02-02 — Monday

## Proactive Work Session (11:00 AM) ✅

Picked "Skill Gap Analysis" from PROACTIVE-IDEAS.md and completed it.

### Created: Skill Gap Analysis
**File:** `~/clawd/research/skill-gap-analysis.md`

Comprehensive review of current capabilities vs. areas for improvement.

**Key findings:**
- **Overall score: 7.5/10** — Strong foundation, key gaps identified
- **Strong areas (9/10):** Research & Analysis, Code & Development
- **Gaps:** Calendar integration, email reading, event-driven triggers, character-consistent images

**Top recommendations:**
1. Set up Google Workspace OAuth (unlocks calendar + email for morning briefs)
2. Build audio auto-transcription watcher script
3. LoRA training for consistent AI characters

### Created: Spawn Templates
**File:** `~/clawd/templates/SPAWN-TEMPLATES.md`

Copy-paste templates for common sub-agent tasks:
- Research swarms (single, multiple scouts, quick research)
- Code work (review, security, architecture, planning)
- Focus groups (persona panels, expert reviews)
- Content creation (copy, blog, docs)
- Lead gen pipeline (full run, single score)
- Analysis (competitor, market)
- Monitoring (GitHub, Twitter)

All templates include the mandatory `Read ~/clawd/AGENTS.md first` prefix.

## Notes
- First proactive work session of February
- Cron job working as expected (triggered 11am)

## Scout Alpha Reliability Fixes (12:00pm)

Updated the overnight research system with:

1. **Auth Pre-Check** — Swarm now tests bird CLI before launching Twitter scouts
   - If auth fails: skip Alpha + Delta, still run Beta + Gamma
   - Prevents entire swarm from failing on auth issues

2. **Retry Logic** — Scout Alpha now retries 3x before marking failed
   - No more placeholder text "[To be filled by deep analysis]"
   - Explicit error logging for failures

3. **Tiered Analysis** — Prioritizes by engagement
   - Tier 1 (Top 15): Full deep analysis
   - Tier 2 (Rest): Light analysis
   - Ensures high-value content always gets analyzed

4. **Better Error Handling** — Every bookmark gets a real status
   - `analyzed: true, status: success` OR
   - `analyzed: true, status: failed` with error message
   - Never left in ambiguous state

Files updated:
- `skills/twitter-research/prompts/scout-alpha.md` — Complete rewrite
- `skills/twitter-research/prompts/swarm-start.md` — Added auth pre-check

## Proactive Work Session (5pm)

Built the **Weekly Twitter Insights** synthesis system:

### Components Created
1. `scripts/weekly-twitter-synthesis.py` — Main analysis script
   - Pulls from `state/bookmarks-catalog.json`
   - Categorizes by themes (AI Agents, Tools, Security, etc.)
   - Identifies trending topics and top authors
   - Generates markdown report

2. `templates/weekly-insights.typ` — Typst PDF template
   - Professional layout with stats boxes
   - Theme sections with color coding
   - Ready for PDF generation

3. `docs/weekly-twitter-insights.md` — System documentation
   - Usage instructions
   - Schedule info
   - Known issues documented

### First Report Generated
`reports/weekly-insights-2026-02-02.md`
- 152 bookmarks this week
- 127 unique authors
- Top voices: @mattshumer_, @morganlinton, @AlexFinn
- Top theme: AI Agents (Karpathy on 150k agent networks, Mission Control guides)

### Key Finding
~95% of bookmarks lack summaries — the scout analysis quality issue is bigger than thought. Most bookmarks only have IDs and authors, no content analysis. This limits the weekly synthesis value.

**Next step:** Fix the scout analysis pipeline to ensure all bookmarks get summaries.
