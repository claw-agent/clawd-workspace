# Daily Notes — Feb 7, 2026

## XPERIENCE Roof Estimator Build Day

### Timeline
- **3:50am** — Ralph Loops launched but Claude Code CLI crashed (`Error: No messages returned`)
- **10:30am** — Marb checked in, discovered it never ran. Multiple debug attempts.
- **12:12pm** — Same crash after fixes (removed --verbose, changed stdin redirect, removed set -e)
- **12:27pm** — Root cause: Claude Code CLI 2.1.25 crashes on ANY tool-use prompt. Text-only works fine.
- **12:43pm** — Pivoted to sessions_spawn loop (Option 2). Marb approved.
- **1:26pm** — First build iteration via sessions_spawn — worked in 2m38s
- **1:37pm** — Deployed to Vercel: https://roof-estimator-ten.vercel.app
- **1:37pm** — Launched parallel QA: Visual QA + Focus Group (3 personas) + Code Review
- **1:39-1:47pm** — All QA reports in. Focus group: 0/3 would convert. Code review: BLOCK.
- **1:42pm** — Launched parallel fix agents (UI + Backend)
- **1:47pm** — Both fix agents done, all critical/major issues resolved
- **1:50pm** — Redeployed with fixes

### Config Changes
- OpenClaw 2026.2.6 → 2026.2.6-3
- contextTokens 250K → 120K (250K caused context overflow)
- reserveTokensFloor 50K → 24K
- memoryFlush 200K → 80K
- Cooldown: billing 1hr → 30min, failure 2hr → 1hr
- Removed orphan crontab (gateway-health-check.sh didn't exist)

### Config Fix (8pm)
- Previous session kept hitting context overflow in a loop (400K contextTokens, 300K flush threshold)
- Root cause: config got bumped to 400K by previous me as a "fix" — way over what's needed
- Fixed: contextTokens 400K → 200K, softThresholdTokens 300K → 120K
- Fixed delivery.to on 5 cron jobs that were missing Telegram chat ID
- All 12 cron jobs verified healthy and enabled

### Evening Session (8pm)
- Marb said "Not fixed, review messages" — reviewed 3 previous session transcripts
- Config is correct now: 200K contextTokens, 120K flush, 35K reserve
- All 12 cron jobs healthy with proper delivery.to fields
- Found: Safari WebSocket spam (every 15s, bad connect params) — needs Safari tab closed
- Found: TOOLS.md at 20,594 chars (limit 20,000) — getting truncated, needs trimming
- OpenClaw tweet review: v2026.2.6 features — token dashboard, skill safety scanner, Voyage AI for memory not yet explored
- Marb hasn't responded yet to status report

### Late Evening (9:40pm)
- Marb sent voice memo (forwarded) about context overflow issues with TOOLS.md size (~20K char limit)
- 1M token context is beta-only for tier 4 API users
- Offered to audit/trim our TOOLS.md and check config — awaiting response

### Compound Review (10:30pm)
- Quiet day overall — mostly config stabilization and automated jobs running
- Morning report delivered successfully (13 bookmarks, 22 repos, 18 news items)
- System health audit scored 8/10 — minor stale files to clean
- Storm dispatcher built proactively at 3am (overnight heartbeat)
- GitHub sentinel: nothing notable

### Lessons
1. **Claude Code CLI 2.1.25 broken for tool use** — `-p` mode with tool calls crashes silently. Don't use.
2. **sessions_spawn > Ralph Loops** — Same pattern, already authenticated, I can orchestrate between iterations. Even better than bash loop.
3. **Context overflow root cause** — Don't chase symptoms by bumping numbers. 200K contextTokens + 120K flush = compaction fires at 60%, plenty of headroom.
4. **Parallel QA → parallel fixes is fast** — Total QA+fix cycle: ~15 minutes for 20+ issues
5. **Two stale `claude login` sessions** were hogging memory — always clean up terminal sessions
6. **Cron delivery needs explicit `to` field** — Without `delivery.to: "8130509493"`, Telegram delivery fails silently
