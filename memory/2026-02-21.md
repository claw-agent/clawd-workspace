## 1:00 AM — Proactive: Spawn Template Refresh
- Picked from PROACTIVE-IDEAS.md
- Full rewrite of `~/clawd/templates/SPAWN-TEMPLATES.md`
- **Fixed:** Reference to nonexistent `deep-research` skill (now uses `research-swarm` or just AGENTS.md)
- **Added 6 new templates:** iOS/React Native, UI architecture, vibe coding, marketing playbook, ABM outbound, idea-to-blueprint
- **Added spawn rules section:** 30s stagger, no plaintext creds, browser→always subagent, one writer per file, success criteria > steps
- **Documented params:** model, cleanup, label, runTimeoutSeconds
- **Added browser automation section** (marked ALWAYS spawn)
- **Added XPERIENCE section** with storm check + demo pipeline templates
- Before: 5.3K, referenced 10 agent files. After: 8.9K, references 14 agent files + 3 skills

## Proactive Work — 3:00 AM

### Claude Code Integration Patterns
Created `~/clawd/reference/claude-code-integration-patterns.md`:
- Decision matrix: Claude Code vs sessions_spawn
- 5 patterns: one-shot, background+monitor, auto-notify, PR review (worktrees), parallel fixes
- Critical rules (pty:true, workdir scoping, no ~/clawd/, stagger spawns)
- Integration with sessions_spawn and cron workflows
- Credential hygiene section
- Troubleshooting table (OOM, hangs, loops)
- Updated PROACTIVE-IDEAS.md
