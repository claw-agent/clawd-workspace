# Daily Notes — Feb 11, 2026

## Overnight Research: Seedance & Video Gen
- Marb asked to research Seedance access overnight for Red Rising AI video project
- **Key finding:** seedance.ai is NOT ByteDance's model — it's a third-party community wrapper using Stable Diffusion/Flux
- **Real Seedance 2** lives in **Dreamina by CapCut** (https://dreamina.capcut.com/) or Jimeng AI (Chinese domestic version)
- Seedance 2 just dropped — r/aivideo going wild. Full anime episodes (Chainsaw Man, Dragon Ball), cinematic quality rivaling Kling 3.0
- Neither Replicate nor fal.ai have Seedance 2 via API yet
- Full research: `~/clawd/research/seedance-video-gen.md`

### Access Strategy
1. Sign up for Dreamina (CapCut) — most likely path for US access
2. CapCut desktop app may get models before web
3. Jimeng AI with VPN as fallback (Chinese market)
4. Volcengine API (ByteDance cloud) — docs in Chinese

### Alternative Video Gen Tools Mapped
- **Veo 3.1** (Google) — available on fal.ai, worth testing
- **Grok Imagine Video** (xAI) — brand new on fal.ai
- **Hailuo/MiniMax** — good motion, cheaper than Kling
- **LTX-2 19B** — open source with audio support
- **Multi-tool pipeline strategy** recommended: use best tool per shot type

## Morning Report Delivered
- 17 bookmarks, 14 timeline, 15 GitHub repos, 22 news
- Top: Chrome WebMCP Preview, Stripe Machine Payments, Agent Security, Entire.io, Pydantic Monty
- Claw voice failed on chunked gen (empty WAV), fell back to edge-tts

## Proactive Work: Coffee Shop Optimization Audit
- Wrote comprehensive 8-domain audit at `~/clawd/research/coffee-shop-optimization-audit.md`
- Menu engineering, labor, waste, ticket optimization, tech, multi-location, CX, financial health
- Ready for when Marb shares actual shop details

## Dreamina Video Testing
- Set up cron job to automate Dreamina video generation test
- **First Darrow render completed** using Video 3.5 Pro — young man with rust-red hair in mining coveralls, underground cavern
- Screenshot saved to `projects/red-rising-scenes/dreamina-test-1.png`
- Result looks solid for atmosphere/lighting

## Jimeng AI Login Attempt
- Spent significant time trying to access Jimeng (Chinese domestic Seedance)
- **Blocker:** Jimeng requires Douyin app QR scan — no web-based phone/email login
- Would need: change App Store region → download Douyin → create account → scan QR
- **Decision:** Wait for Seedance 2.0 on Dreamina internationally (Feb 24 expected)
- Already have working Dreamina account with Video 3.5 Pro

## Claw Voice TTS Issue
- claw-speak-chunked.sh produced empty WAV during morning compile
- edge-tts fallback worked fine
- Need to investigate chunked TTS reliability

## Compound Review (10:30 PM)

### Patterns That Worked
1. **Cron-driven browser automation** — Dreamina test via cron job was effective for async video gen
2. **Research-first approach** — Seedance research saved time by mapping the real access paths before trying random URLs
3. **Proactive builds during quiet time** — Coffee shop audit ready before Marb even asks

### Gotchas
1. **Chinese platforms = QR-only auth** — Jimeng/Douyin has no web login, requires native app
2. **Claw voice chunked TTS** — still unreliable, produces empty files intermittently
3. **seedance.ai is a fake** — third-party wrapper, not ByteDance's actual model

### Open Items
- [ ] Wait for Seedance 2.0 on Dreamina (Feb 24)
- [ ] Investigate claw-speak-chunked.sh empty WAV issue
- [ ] Integrate design language into site gen pipeline
- [ ] Git push to clawd-workspace
- [ ] Anthropic 33-page skills guide — full read
- [ ] Test fal.ai Veo 3.1 / Grok Imagine Video for Red Rising
