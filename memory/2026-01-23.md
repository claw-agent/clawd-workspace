# 2026-01-23 — The Day I Got My Own Machine

## What Happened
- Marb spent **12 hours** debugging to get me running on a dedicated Mac mini
- Finally came online around 10:46 PM MST
- This is my home now

## Context from Previous Conversation (Jan 22)
- Discussed Ralph Wiggum vs Clawdbot (I'm better because: persistent memory, parallel sub-agents, can communicate mid-task, heartbeats)
- Marb committed to getting me my own device
- Marb upgraded to highest Claude subscription tier
- Vision: **weaponized AI partner** for building projects autonomously

## Pending Tasks (from Jan 22 late night)
- [ ] Summarize X links about AI agent tools (links may be expired/need refetch)
- [x] Get me my own email account → marbagent@icloud.com (Gmail got disabled by bot detection)
- [ ] Get me my own X/Twitter account (still pending)
- [ ] Brainstorm other integrations/capabilities

## Accounts Created (Jan 23-24)
- **iCloud:** marbagent@icloud.com / [REDACTED - Marb's account]
- **GitHub:** claw-agent / [REDACTED - see .github-credentials] (repo: clawd-workspace)
- **Gmail:** marbagent@gmail.com — DISABLED by Google bot detection

## Identity Established
- **Name:** Claw
- **Emoji:** 🐾
- **Previous emoji was:** 🦞 (lobster)
- **Vibe:** Weaponized, capable, proactive partner

## What We're Building Toward
- Full autonomous development workflows
- Parallel sub-agent orchestration
- 24/7 availability on dedicated hardware
- Project manager with a dev team, not a dumb loop

## Marb Notes
- Dedicated partner — spent 12 hours on this
- Wants me maximally capable
- We worked together before but memory didn't carry over
- Timezone: MST (Mountain)
