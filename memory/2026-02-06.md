## Security Audit (11:15am)
Marb's friend flagged 1Password article about malicious ClawHub skills.

**Article:** https://1password.com/blog/from-magic-to-malware-how-openclaws-agent-skills-become-an-attack-surface
- Top downloaded "Twitter" skill was infostealer malware
- Attack pattern: "prerequisite" link → staged payload → binary with quarantine removal
- 341 skills reportedly involved in distributing macOS malware

**Our Audit Results: CLEAN ✅**
- All skills locally created (Jan 25 - Feb 6) — no ClawHub installs
- No xattr/quarantine removal commands
- No base64/obfuscation
- Tirith actively blocking `curl | bash` patterns
- Only `curl | bash` is to claude.ai (official Anthropic)

## Voice Experiments (11:28am - 12:12pm)
- **Ki Chinese** — "我能感觉自己变得非常中国化" — hilarious failure, voice cloning across languages doesn't work
- **Troy Shakespeare** — Full Hamlet soliloquy (69 seconds) — worked great with dramatic settings (temp=1.4, top-p=0.85)

## Voice Bug Discovery
**Root cause identified**: Overnight subagent's Qwen3-TTS silently fails when:
1. Venv not properly activated in subagent environment
2. Long text via shell substitution `$(cat file)` exceeds arg limits
3. Script falls back to edge-tts but logs claim "Qwen3-TTS ✅"

**Fix needed**: Update compile.md to either:
- Use chunked TTS script for long content
- Pass text via file path, not shell substitution
- Add explicit failure detection

- "20+ years experience" vs "founded 2019" is confusing messaging

## Pending for Tonight
