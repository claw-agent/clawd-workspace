# Daily Notes — Feb 10, 2026

## Morning Report Review
Marb went through the Feb 10 morning report at ~3:30pm. Sent a long voice note with requests.

### Key Requests from Voice Note
1. **Monty by Pydantic** — wants action items, how it replaces Docker in our stack
2. **UI quality** — wants cleaner, less generic roofing sites for XPERIENCE
3. **Anthropic 33-page skills guide** — wants us to read and compare against our skills
4. **Compound engineering** (Plan→Work→Assess→Compound) — directly relevant to our self-improvement loop
5. **9-domain automation map** — break down for XPERIENCE client onboarding
6. **Agent team orchestration** (@ryancarson) — find full resource
7. **Chrome native agent browsing** — could eliminate CDP/Playwright layer
8. **"Eight More Months of Agents"** + **13 AI coding lessons** — practical wisdom
9. **Dexter** — financial research agent, potentially useful for XPERIENCE pricing
10. **Voxtral Mini 4B** — evaluate vs our Whisper setup (low priority)
11. **Compound engineering plugin** (GitHub) — review in depth
12. **RLMs paper** + **Anthropic safety exodus** — threads worth reading

### Skipped (Marb's call)
- Prediction market insider tracking (outside scope)
- OpenClaw as service offering (not now)
- Utilization limit optimization (not hitting limits, could create failure vectors)

## Research Swarms Deployed
- feb10-research-1: Monty, Anthropic guide, compound engineering, Chrome agents, Carson guide
- feb10-research-2: 8 months agents, 13 lessons, 9-domain audit, RLMs, Anthropic exodus, Dexter
- voxtral-eval: Voxtral vs Whisper
- roofing-ui-research: ✅ COMPLETED — full design language spec

## Roofing UI Design Language ✅
Comprehensive spec written to `~/clawd/research/roofing-ui-design-language.md`.
Key findings: Hook Agency formula dominates. Blue+orange color scheme. Customer-centric headlines.
XPERIENCE specific: navy #1a1f3d + burnt orange #e85d26, "X" motif, Utah weather hooks.

## Evening Session — Builds & Research

### Subagent Crash Investigation
- **Root cause:** undici@7.21.0 TLS session reuse race condition
- 3+ simultaneous spawns → concurrent web_fetch → null pointer in TLSSocket.setSession
- Crashes entire gateway, all subagents lost
- 8 total crashes in logs. Also triggers ggml-metal assertion on cleanup
- **Fix:** Stagger spawns ~30s apart. Documented in AGENTS.md

### Research Delivered to Marb
- **Monty:** Cool but too early — no stdlib, no classes, experimental. Watch.
- **Compound Engineering:** Plan→Work→Review→Compound. Adopted learning capture into AGENTS.md.
- **Dexter:** Wrong domain for roofing. Skip.
- **Chrome Native Browsing:** Huge if ships, eliminates CDP/Playwright. Watch.
- **Crawshaw "Eight More Months":** Frontier models only, IDEs dead, no sandboxes, build for programmers.
- **"13 hype-free lessons":** Couldn't find original Reddit post.

### Builds Completed
1. **service-business-v2.html** — Major template upgrade with design language spec improvements
   - Plus Jakarta Sans + Inter fonts, clamp() fluid typography
   - Mobile sticky CTA bar, FAQ accordion, before/after slider
   - Animated counters, scroll-reveal, premium card shadows
   - Located: `~/clawd/projects/slc-lead-gen/templates/sites/service-business-v2.html`
2. **Roofing operations audit** — 9-domain framework at `~/clawd/systems/xperience/roofing-operations-audit.md`
3. **AGENTS.md updates** — Compound engineering cycle + subagent stagger warning

### Pipeline Integration Plan (deferred to Feb 11)
- v2 template needs to be integrated into the actual revamp-generator pipeline
- Template variable hooks must match existing `{{variable}}` structure
- Plan: merge v2 patterns into v1 template, run full 5-agent pipeline, deploy to Vercel
- Deferred because Marb was post-anesthesia and not at Mac mini

## System Health Audit (automated, 4am)
- Score: 8/10 — all 12 cron jobs clean, no errors
- Minor: empty scaffold dirs, old bookmark JSON in memory/

## Marb Notes
- Had anesthesia today — groggy but engaged
- Not at Mac mini, wanted results via Telegram
- Loves direct/blunt approach — "super helpful"
- Gave full green light on UI improvements and operations audit

## Compound Review (10:30pm)
### Patterns That Worked
1. **Research-first builds** — UI design language spec → template was much stronger than building blind
2. **Voice note processing pipeline** — Marb sends voice → transcribe → parse into action items → execute. Clean loop.
3. **Telegram delivery for remote work** — Marb away from Mac, all deliverables via message. Worked well.
4. **Staggered spawns** — After diagnosing the undici crash, spacing spawns prevented further crashes

### Gotchas
1. **undici TLS crash** — 3+ simultaneous spawns = gateway crash. Must stagger ~30s.
2. **Template integration ≠ template creation** — Built v2 standalone but pipeline uses v1 with agent-generated content. Need to merge, not replace.
3. **Reddit search unreliable** — Couldn't find "13 hype-free lessons" post despite multiple attempts

### Preferences Learned
- Marb wants **opinions with research deliverables**, not just summaries
- Green-lit compound engineering adoption immediately — values self-improvement systems
- Prefers "here's what I built + here's what's next" over asking permission

### Open Items → Feb 11
- Integrate v2 design into pipeline template, run full generation, deploy
- Read Anthropic 33-page skills guide in full
- Git push (136MB issue resolved, needs actual push)
- Preview v1 vs v2 side-by-side for Marb
- OpenClaw version check (npm 2026.2.6-3 vs 2026.2.9)
