## 1:00 AM — Proactive: Workspace Disk Audit

- Full audit of ~/clawd (6.8G total)
- **Cleaned:** build caches in bjorns-brew (.next/cache, node_modules/.cache) + xperience-pricing-tool (.next/cache) = ~160M freed
- **Archived:** morning reports Feb 7-9 to reports/archive/
- **Key findings:** Qwen3-TTS has its own 1.2G .venv (duplicate of main), sim-studio (526M) unclear if used, torch (402M) in main .venv may be redundant
- **Potential savings:** ~2.4G if Marb approves removing sim-studio, consolidating venvs, archiving dormant node_modules
- Report: `~/clawd/reports/disk-audit-2026-02-20.md`

## 3:00 AM — Proactive: Weekly Recap Automation

- Added cron job: Sunday 9am MT, isolated session, announces summary to Marb
- Output: `reports/weekly-recap-YYYY-WNN.md`
