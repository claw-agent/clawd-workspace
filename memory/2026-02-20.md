# Daily Notes — Feb 20, 2026

## 1:00 AM — Proactive: Workspace Disk Audit
- Full audit of ~/clawd (6.8G total), ~160M freed from build caches
- Archived morning reports Feb 7-9
- Potential: ~2.4G savings if sim-studio + venv consolidation approved
- Report: `~/clawd/reports/disk-audit-2026-02-20.md`

## 3:00 AM — Proactive: Weekly Recap Automation
- Built `scripts/weekly-recap.sh` — generates markdown recap from daily notes, git log, proactive completions
- Tested on W08 (Feb 16-20): 134-line recap, 17 commits, 13 proactive items
- Added cron: Sunday 9am MT, isolated session, announces to Marb

## 6:00 AM — Morning Report Compiled
- 5 bookmarks, 18 timeline posts, 9 GitHub repos, 8+ news items
- Heavy day: OpenClaw C&D from Anthropic, Claude data leak, Gemini 3.1 Pro
- PDF: `reports/morning-2026-02-20/morning-report.pdf`

## 7:00 AM — Morning Report Delivered
- Text + PDF sent via Telegram

## Afternoon — Moonwalk Fitness iOS Build Session
- Marb asked to build the app. Spawned subagents for iOS simulator build.
- **Metro kept getting SIGKILL'd** — macOS memory pressure on Mac Mini
- Dev menu kept auto-showing on simulator
- Multiple exec failures logged (SIGKILL signals)
- Session grew to **13.6MB** — critical size, needs rotation
- Marb asked for screenshots + error details
- Status: build unstable, Metro crashing, needs production bundle or memory fix

## 10:30 PM — Compound Review

### Patterns That Worked
1. **Weekly recap automation** — Built a script that auto-generates weekly summaries from existing data. Zero ongoing cost.
2. **Proactive disk audits** — Found 2.4G potential savings before disk became an issue
3. **Morning report pipeline stable** — Day 12+ of reliable overnight→compile→deliver. Zero errors today.
4. **All 12+ crons healthy** — No failures, no empty outputs

### Gotchas
1. **Metro SIGKILL on Mac Mini** — iOS dev server eats too much RAM alongside OpenClaw + Ollama. Need to kill Ollama before heavy builds or use production bundles.
2. **13.6MB session file** — Main interactive session is dangerously large. Will cause compaction issues. Need `/new` or session rotation.
3. **Subagent exec failures** — Two SIGKILL'd exec processes during Moonwalk build. Memory pressure is the root cause.

### Preferences Confirmed
- Marb wants to **see screenshots** of app state, not just text descriptions
- Prefers **quick status checks** ("can we build it yet?") — wants terse yes/no + blockers
- Still action-oriented: "grab some screenshots and let me know"

### Drift Check
- ⚠️ **Session size drift** — Main session at 13.6MB, should have been rotated earlier
- ⚠️ **Memory pressure not anticipated** — Should have warned Marb that iOS builds + all background services would compete for RAM
- ✅ No unauthorized external actions
- ✅ No recommending tools we already have

### Subagent Observability
**Sessions modified in last 24h:** 18 files
- **All crons ran successfully:** overnight-research, skill-evolution, nightly-git-push, proactive (2x), morning-compile, morning-deliver, github-sentinel (3x), heartbeats
- **⚠️ 2 exec SIGKILL failures** in main session (Metro build processes killed by OS)
- **⚠️ Main session 13.6MB** — critical, needs rotation
- **No subagent failures** — proactive and research sessions all completed normally

### Open Items
1. **Moonwalk iOS build** — Metro keeps crashing from memory pressure. Need strategy: kill Ollama during builds? Production bundle?
2. **Session rotation** — Main session at 13.6MB, needs `/new`
3. **9 morning report action items** — still pending from Feb 18
4. **XPERIENCE** — Monday follow-up meeting
5. **Mitte AI signup** — still needs manual browser
6. **Disk cleanup** — 2.4G potential savings awaiting Marb's approval
7. **Feb 20 report** — delivered but not reviewed with Marb
