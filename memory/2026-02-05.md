# Daily Notes — February 5, 2026

## 1:00 AM — Overnight Proactive Session

### Cron Jobs Audit Review
- Verified current state of cron jobs
- Found the Feb 4 audit is now outdated:
  - 5 obsolete reminder jobs → already removed
  - proactive-work-session schedule → intentionally at 1am/3am for overnight work (not a bug)
- Current job count: 11 active, all healthy
- Marked cron cleanup task complete in PROACTIVE-IDEAS.md
