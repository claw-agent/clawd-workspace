# Daily Notes — February 5, 2026

## 1:00 AM — Overnight Proactive Session

### Cron Jobs Audit Review
- Verified current state of cron jobs
- Found the Feb 4 audit is now outdated:
  - 5 obsolete reminder jobs → already removed
  - proactive-work-session schedule → intentionally at 1am/3am for overnight work (not a bug)
- Current job count: 11 active, all healthy
- Marked cron cleanup task complete in PROACTIVE-IDEAS.md

### Google Solar API Validation (XPERIENCE)
**Major progress for Thursday's meeting!**

Tested Google Solar API across 8 Salt Lake County addresses:
- ✅ 100% success rate
- Coverage confirmed for: 84111, 84106, 84107, 84094, 84103, 84020, 84124, 84117
- Imagery dates: 2017-2022 (varies by area)

**Key metrics returned:**
| Location | Roof sqft | Squares | Pitch | Category |
|----------|-----------|---------|-------|----------|
| Downtown | 14,377 | 143.8 | 18.4° | steep |
| Sugar House | 8,930 | 89.3 | 3.2° | flat |
| Murray | 1,058 | 10.6 | 7.0° | standard |
| Sandy | 1,881 | 18.8 | 18.4° | steep |
| Marmalade | 10,704 | 107.0 | 14.7° | steep |
| Draper | 6,802 | 68.0 | 20.5° | steep |
| Millcreek | 1,636 | 16.4 | 38.0° | very steep |
| Holladay | 445 | 4.5 | 37.5° | very steep |

**Scripts created:**
1. `~/clawd/projects/xperience/scripts/roof-analyzer.sh` — Single address analysis
2. `~/clawd/projects/xperience/scripts/batch-roof-analysis.sh` — Batch processing

**Documentation:**
- `~/clawd/projects/xperience/SOLAR-API-VALIDATION.md`

**Next steps for XPERIENCE:**
1. Get their pricing formula
2. Integrate Utah SGID data
3. Build full estimator combining all sources

## 3:00 AM — Overnight Proactive Session (Continued)

### XPERIENCE Pitch One-Pager Created
Built a concise leave-behind for Thursday's meeting.

**File:** `~/clawd/research/xperience/PITCH-ONE-PAGER.pdf`

**Contents:**
- Problem/Solution framing (door-to-door is dead, AI targeting is alive)
- Visual pipeline: TARGET → ANALYZE → QUOTE
- Proof points: 271K homes, 8/8 API validation, $0.01/roof cost
- Sample lead card showing what output looks like
- Cost breakdown ($300-500/mo for 1,000 leads)
- ROI math (80x return at $8K avg job value)
- Clear CTA: "Share pricing formula → We build estimator"

**Why this matters:**
The existing reports are 10-50 pages — great for deep dives but not for a pitch meeting. This one-pager gives Marb something to:
1. Guide the conversation visually
2. Leave behind as a reminder
3. Focus on the single ask: get their pricing formula

## 22:30 — Compound Review

### Summary
Execution day — no new gotchas. Pitch prep complete for tomorrow's XPERIENCE meeting.

### What Worked
- Proactive overnight sessions (1am/3am) produced tangible deliverables
- Google Solar API validation (8/8 SLC addresses = 100% success)
- One-pager format better than lengthy docs for pitch meetings

### Open Items → Tomorrow
- **XPERIENCE meeting (Feb 6)** — Materials ready, key ask: get pricing formula
- Xactimate research — nice-to-have if they don't have own formula
- 6am session reset cron — still pending (low priority)

### Files Updated
- `memory/context/active.md` — Updated for meeting day
- `MEMORY.md` — Added Hybrid DSM formula as reusable technical pattern
