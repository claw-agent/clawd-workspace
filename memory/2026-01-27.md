## Browser Setup Overhaul (9:00 AM - 9:30 AM) ✅

### Problem
- Clawdbot's built-in browser tool (CDP) was flaky — timeouts, control server issues
- Screenshot+vision approach lost context (links, threads, videos)
- Marb wanted a proper solution for rigorous research

### Solution: browser-use
Installed and configured browser-use for reliable Twitter access:

**Installation:**
```bash
source ~/clawd/.venv/bin/activate
pip install browser-use  # v0.11.4
```

**What Works:**
- Persistent sessions with `--session claw`
- Real Chrome profile at `~/clawd/browser-profiles/claw-chrome`
- Reads actual DOM content (not screenshots!)
- Can see: tweet text, authors, timestamps, engagement, links, media
- Can interact: click threads, scroll, type, navigate

**Twitter Login:**
- Account: @ClawA94248 (claw-agent@proton.me / [REDACTED])
- Logged in successfully via browser-use CLI
- Session persists across commands

**Key Commands:**
```bash
source ~/clawd/.venv/bin/activate
browser-use --session claw open "https://x.com/i/bookmarks"
browser-use --session claw state  # Get readable content
browser-use --session claw scroll down
browser-use --session claw click [index]
```

### Files Updated
- `skills/twitter-research/SKILL.md` → Version 3.0 with browser-use
- `TOOLS.md` → Added browser-use section

### Tools Compared
| Tool | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Clawdbot browser (CDP) | ❌ Flaky | Timeouts, control server issues |
| agent-browser (Vercel) | ✅ Installed | Alternative, less tested |
| stealth-browse | ✅ Works | For bot detection bypass |
| **browser-use** | ⭐ PRIMARY | Reliable, persistent, reads DOM |
| cliclick | ✅ Backup | Raw mouse/keyboard if needed |

### What Marb Wanted
"I don't think the screenshot approach works because a lot of these have links and threads and video analysis... there has to be a better way."

### What We Delivered
Full DOM access — can read actual text, follow links, click into threads. Way more rigorous than screenshots.

## Comprehensive Bookmark Research (9:30 AM - 9:47 AM) ✅

### Methodology Improvements
- Scrolled 12x to get ALL bookmarks (not just 2x)
- Tracking by content/topic, not by handle (Marb's feedback)
- Deep dives with linked content, threads, video analysis

### Results
- **22 unique bookmarks** found
- **5 previously analyzed** (from earlier report)
- **17 new** deep dives completed

### Video Analysis
- Downloaded @mvanhorn's /last30days video (1:50)
- No audio (screen recording) → extracted 55 frames with ffmpeg
- Used vision to analyze frame content
- Key finding: Shows engagement rankings, validates our overnight research approach

### Key Bookmarks Analyzed
1. **Dario Amodei — "Adolescence of Technology"**
   - 15,000+ word essay
   - Powerful AI in 1-2 years
   - "Country of geniuses in a datacenter"
   - 5 risk categories: autonomy, destruction, power seizure, economics, indirect

2. **@mvanhorn — /last30days**
   - Claude Code skill for research aggregation
   - Validates our overnight research pipeline
   - Top 5 by engagement: Email automation, task management, overnight coding agent

3. **@damianplayer — MILLIONS in free alpha**
   - $2-10M businesses still emailing themselves notes
   - "They've never opened Claude"
   - Opportunity: AI workflow consulting after website revamps

4. **Kimi K2.5**
   - Open-source, 8x cheaper than Opus 4.5
   - Agent Swarm for parallel task execution
   - SWE-bench 76.8%, BrowseComp 74.9%

## System Audit & Cleanup (12:30 PM) ✅

### What Was Fixed
1. ✅ **Deleted stale state file** — `skills/twitter-research/state.json` (was conflicting with `memory/twitter-research-state.json`)
2. ✅ **Removed empty skill folders** — `tools/`, `domains/`, `workflows/`
3. ✅ **Removed everything-claude-code clutter** — 109 unused files
4. ✅ **Scrubbed credentials** — Removed plain-text password from memory logs
5. ✅ **Fixed LOCKED.md vs SKILL.md conflict** — Updated LOCKED.md with new format, removed override
6. ✅ **Updated TOOLS.md** — Noted underutilized agents

### Still TODO
- Implement email/calendar checks in heartbeat
- Enable web search (or document why disabled)
- Update USER.md pronouns

### Audit Grade: B+ → Working toward A

## New Project Kickoff: LeadGen SaaS (10:50 PM)

**Big vision:** AI-powered lead generation SaaS platform
- Customer inputs their business + target market
- Agent swarms autonomously find and research prospects
- Deep research each prospect (not just database lookup)
- Find contact info, generate personalized outreach
- Human approval step, then automated outreach

**Key differentiator:** True agent orchestration, not just LLM wrappers like competitors

**Marb's direction:**
- Target both SMBs and Enterprise (tiered)
- Broad vertical (AI analyzes and adapts)
- Email primary, open to LinkedIn/calling
- MVP includes full outreach automation with approval step
- Partnership mode - I'm a co-builder, not just executing tasks

**Research swarm launched:** leadgen-research-orchestrator
- Competitive analysis (Apollo, ZoomInfo, Instantly, etc.)
- Tools/APIs and pricing
- Architecture design

---

## Tapflow: Idea to Blueprint (10:50 PM - 12:00 AM) ✅

### The Vision
Marb wanted to build an AI-powered lead generation SaaS. I executed the full research-to-blueprint pipeline in ~1 hour.

### Agent Swarm Deployed
| Agent | Output |
|-------|--------|
| leadgen-research-orchestrator | Market research, competitive analysis, pricing |
| architect-leadgen | Technical architecture, stack decisions, DB schema |
| designer-leadgen | UI/UX spec, wireframes, component library |
| brand-leadgen | Name (Tapflow), taglines, visual direction |
| swarm-engineer-leadgen | 7 agent specs with full prompts |
| business-plan-writer | 46-page investor-grade business plan |
| master-blueprint-compiler | 40-page combined blueprint |

### Final Deliverables
```
~/clawd/projects/leadgen-saas/
├── RESEARCH-REPORT.pdf (16 pages)
├── TAPFLOW-BUSINESS-PLAN.pdf (46 pages)
├── TAPFLOW-MASTER-BLUEPRINT.pdf (40 pages)
├── architecture/TECHNICAL-ARCHITECTURE.pdf
├── design/UI-SPEC.md
├── brand/BRAND-GUIDE.md
└── agents/ (7 agent prompts)
```

### Key Decisions
- **Name:** Tapflow ("Tap into leads. Let them flow.")
- **Stack:** Vercel + Supabase + Inngest
- **Pricing:** $99 / $299 / $799 / Enterprise
- **MVP Timeline:** 4 weeks
- **Break-even:** ~50 users

### Process Captured as Skill
Created `~/clawd/skills/idea-to-blueprint/SKILL.md` so this entire workflow can be repeated for any future idea. One command → full blueprint in 30-45 min.

### Marb's Reaction
"This was incredible. The research, the technical doc, the business plan and the master blueprint… all amazing!"

## TTS Auto-Detection (12:30 AM)

Added intelligent mood detection to all voice scripts:

**How it works:**
- `tts-analyze.py` scans text for keywords/patterns
- Detects: love, funny, dramatic, serious, sad, excited
- Auto-adjusts temperature, top_p, repetition_penalty

**Examples:**
- "I love you" → love → temp=1.15 (warm)
- "Quarterly report" → serious → temp=0.85 (consistent)  
- "HAHA hilarious" → funny → temp=1.25 (playful)

**Updated scripts:**
- `troy-speak.sh` ✅
- `ki-speak.sh` ✅
- `claw-speak.sh` ✅

All support manual override with `--temp`, `--top-p`, etc.
- Pricing model
- MVP feature spec
- Go-to-market strategy

Project folder: `~/clawd/projects/leadgen-saas/`
