## Proactive: Agent Cost Tracker (1am)
Built `~/clawd/systems/agent-cost-tracker/` — Python script analyzing OpenClaw session token usage.

**Key findings:**
- Total estimated cost for active sessions: ~$22
- Monthly projection: ~$88/mo at current usage
- Highest cost jobs: proactive-work-session ($2.14), github-sentinel ($2.02)
- Flagged 5 inefficient jobs with high context/output ratios (loading full context for minimal work):
  - github-sentinel (737x ratio) — runs every 4h, usually finds nothing
  - nightly-git-push (1353x) — simple script, huge context overhead
  - weekly-maintenance (994x) — same pattern
- Outputs: markdown, HTML dashboard, JSON
- Note: These are API-rate estimates. Actual cost depends on subscription vs API billing.
