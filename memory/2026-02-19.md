## Proactive: Agent Cost Tracker (1am)
Built `~/clawd/systems/agent-cost-tracker/` — Python script analyzing OpenClaw session token usage.

**Key findings:**
- Total estimated cost for active sessions: ~$22
- Monthly projection: ~$88/mo at current usage
- Highest cost jobs: proactive-work-session ($2.14), github-sentinel ($2.02)
- Flagged 5 inefficient jobs with high context/output ratios (loading full context for minimal work):
  - github-sentinel (737x ratio) — runs every 4h, usually finds nothing
  - nightly-git-push (1353x) — simple script, huge context overhead
  - weekly-maintenance (994x) — same pattern
- Outputs: markdown, HTML dashboard, JSON
- Note: These are API-rate estimates. Actual cost depends on subscription vs API billing.

## 3am — Proactive: Research Folder Pruning
- Audited ~/clawd/research/ — had 421 files, 95MB
- Archived to research/archive/2026-01-old/:
  - 2026-01-26/videos/ (89 extracted frames, 12MB) + video-analysis/ (49MB MP3)
  - 15 stale Jan 24 brainstorm files (superseded by actual projects)
  - Jan bookmark research dirs (4 dirs, 51 files — already synthesized)
  - cortisol-burnout, troy-mineer, professional-docs, agent-architecture dirs
  - 5 feb report followup files (already acted on)
- Result: 337 active files, 24MB active (71MB reduction)
- Updated INDEX.md with clean categorized listing
- Daily-rotating dirs (bookmarks, github, news, timeline) left in place — they're the morning report feed
