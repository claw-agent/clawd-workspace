# Daily Notes — Feb 19, 2026

## Proactive: Agent Cost Tracker (1am)
Built `~/clawd/systems/agent-cost-tracker/` — Python script analyzing OpenClaw session token usage.

**Key findings:**
- Total estimated cost for active sessions: ~$22
- Monthly projection: ~$88/mo at current usage
- Highest cost jobs: proactive-work-session ($2.14), github-sentinel ($2.02)
- Flagged 5 inefficient jobs with high context/output ratios (loading full context for minimal work):
  - github-sentinel (737x ratio) — runs every 4h, usually finds nothing
  - nightly-git-push (1353x) — simple script, huge context overhead
  - weekly-maintenance (994x) — same pattern
- Outputs: markdown, HTML dashboard, JSON
- Note: These are API-rate estimates. Actual cost depends on subscription vs API billing.

## 3am — Proactive: Research Folder Pruning
- Audited ~/clawd/research/ — had 421 files, 95MB
- Archived to research/archive/2026-01-old/:
  - 2026-01-26/videos/ (89 extracted frames, 12MB) + video-analysis/ (49MB MP3)
  - 15 stale Jan 24 brainstorm files (superseded by actual projects)
  - Jan bookmark research dirs (4 dirs, 51 files — already synthesized)
  - cortisol-burnout, troy-mineer, professional-docs, agent-architecture dirs
  - 5 feb report followup files (already acted on)
- Result: 337 active files, 24MB active (71MB reduction)
- Updated INDEX.md with clean categorized listing
- Daily-rotating dirs (bookmarks, github, news, timeline) left in place — they're the morning report feed

## 6am — Morning Report Compiled
- PDF: `reports/morning-2026-02-19/morning-report.pdf` (321KB)
- New bookmarks: 0 (all 255 already cataloged)
- Timeline posts: 18 captured, GitHub repos: 15 scanned (3 featured)
- ⚠️ Critical item: Anthropic subscription auth ban — needs attention
- First report with improved quality rules (dedup, capped GitHub, shorter summaries)

## 7am — Morning Report Delivered
Text summary + PDF sent to Marb via Telegram.

## 10am — System Health Audit
Score 8/10. All 12 crons healthy, zero errors. Disk 20% used (65G free). Memory lean. Minor: 8 empty scaffold dirs, reports dir at 72MB.

## Afternoon-Evening — Interactive Session with Marb
- XPERIENCE meeting happened — nothing material, follow-up Monday
- **Mitte AI / Seedance 2.0 research** — big topic of the day:
  - Discovered JSON frame-by-frame video gen via Mitte's "Omni mode"
  - Subagent researched pricing, JSON format, compared to ChatCut/Dreamina
  - JSON control is significantly more granular than alternatives
  - Prepared Red Rising Darrow mine scene JSON prompt (4 shots, 10s)
  - Catch: Seedance 2 is Pro/Power only, site is JS SPA (needs manual signup)
  - Written to: `~/clawd/research/mitte-ai-seedance2.md`
- Marb interested in Red Rising application specifically
- Context loss moment: jumped to report items when Marb wanted to continue Mitte discussion

## 11pm — Skill Evolution (ran late 18th, logged here)
Updated 3 skills: morning-report (quality rules), twitter-research (error handling), ai-compound (session health monitoring)

## 10:30 PM — Compound Review

### Patterns That Worked
1. **Subagent for research** — Mitte research spawned as subagent, kept main context clean, good results in 5m
2. **Proactive housekeeping overnight** — research folder pruning (71MB reduction) and cost analysis done while Marb slept
3. **Morning report quality improvements kicking in** — dedup tracker, capped GitHub repos, shorter format
4. **Skill evolution loop** — automated self-improvement from execution data is paying off

### Gotchas
1. **Context loss → jumped topics** — When Marb said "meeting is done, let's do this" (meaning Mitte), I pivoted to report items instead. Need to track conversation thread better.
2. **JS SPA blocking subagent signup** — Mitte.ai couldn't be automated. Browser relay would be needed for JS-heavy sites.
3. **Credential in subagent task** — Passed claw-agent password in plaintext spawn task. Should reference config file instead.

### Preferences Learned
- Marb is interested in **Red Rising creative projects** — video gen for the book series is a genuine passion project
- Prefers to **stay on topic** until explicitly moving on — don't redirect to other items
- XPERIENCE meetings: wants brief status, not deep prep if nothing happened

### Drift Check
- ⚠️ **Context loss drift** — Jumped from Mitte to report items when Marb said "let's do this." Should have stayed on Mitte.
- ✅ No unauthorized external actions
- ✅ No recommending tools we already have
- ✅ No deferred work — proactive sessions completed all planned items

### Subagent Observability
**Sessions in last 24h:** ~18 total
- **All crons ran on schedule:** github-sentinel (6x), proactive (2x), overnight-research, morning-compile, morning-deliver, nightly-git-push, skill-evolution, compound-review, system-health-audit
- **No failed sessions**
- **No empty/minimal output**
- **1 subagent spawned:** Mitte research (5m21s, 40K tokens — normal for research task)
- **4 deleted sessions** from overnight cleanup (working as expected)
- **Largest session:** main interactive at 12.8MB — still growing, may need rotation consideration

### Open Items
1. **Mitte AI signup** — needs manual browser, Marb to sign up
2. **Red Rising JSON test clip** — ready to paste once Mitte access acquired
3. **9 morning report action items** — only Mitte (#8-area) discussed, rest pending
4. **XPERIENCE follow-up** — Monday meeting
5. **Chatterbox TTS evaluation** (from episodic)
6. **Morning report PDF delivery path fix** (from episodic)
