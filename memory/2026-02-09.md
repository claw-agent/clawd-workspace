# Daily Notes — February 9, 2026

## Red Rising Video Project Progress

### Book 2 Full Text Extracted
- Marb sent Golden Son epub (the earlier PDF was just a preview — 26 pages/16KB)
- Extracted via ebooklib+BeautifulSoup → 786K chars at `golden-son-book2-full.txt`
- Also sent a duplicate epub as backup (confirmed identical)

### Character Bible & Scenes Updated
- Spawned two agents to fill in Book 2 content
- Character bible: +10 new characters (Ragnar, Victra, Roque, Tactus, Lorn, Jackal, Aja, Kavax, Daxo, Lysander) + 6 existing updated
- Scene breakdowns: 12 scenes with exact quotes, replaced all [FULL TEXT NEEDED] placeholders
- Generated 4 PDFs and sent to Marb via Telegram

### Kling 3.0 Access Unlocked!
- Marb got Pro subscription → IMAGE 3.0 Omni + VIDEO 3.0 available
- Started generating Darrow (Red) reference images
- Gen 1: Too gaunt/waxy face (overloaded prompt)
- Gen 2: Much better with simplified prompt — locked right image as candidate
- Tested "Darrow from Red Rising" direct prompt — model doesn't know the character
- Image refinement tool has limited effect
- **Next: Generate Eo reference, then first video test**

### YELO Deck
- Marb asked for YELO feedback overview
- Shared from memory: dark palette good, but too uniform, no imagery, flat black, logo just "Y", no trust signals
- Direction: Quick Polish first, Full Redesign after

### Morning Report Delivered
- 3 bookmarks, 15 timeline posts, 14 GitHub repos, 27 news items
- Top: Opus 4.6 safety study, Mollick agent org theory, Qwen 3.5, Super Bowl AI chaos

Marb reviewed Feb 8 morning brief. Action items:

### Shannon Pentester
- GitHub: KeygraphHQ/shannon — autonomous AI pentester, 96% success rate
- Clone and run against our Vercel deployments
- TypeScript, uses browser to execute real exploits
- Keygraph.io is the parent platform

### Heretic (Model Uncensoring)
- GitHub: p-e-w/heretic — removes safety guardrails from open-source models via "abliteration"
- Not needed now (not running local models much) but bookmarked for future reference

### Firecrawl — research spawned
### Gateway Watchdog — research spawned
### Marketing Playbook — building agent structure

### Qwen 3.5 — not released yet, just a PR. Watch list.

## Shannon Pentester Installed (18:20 MST)
- Cloned https://github.com/KeygraphHQ/shannon.git → `~/clawd/tools/shannon/`
- Docker-based autonomous AI pentester (white-box, source-aware)
- Requires: Docker + Anthropic API key. No local npm install needed — runs in containers
- Passed security audit (no curl|bash, no obfuscated code, clean bash wrapper)
- Documented usage in TOOLS.md under "### Shannon (Pentesting)"
- NOT run against any targets — install only

## Evening Session with Marb (4pm-6:20pm)

### OpenClaw 2026.2.9 Update
- Marb updated OpenClaw to 2026.2.9 (already running)
- Key fixes: post-compaction amnesia, context overflow recovery, cron reliability, Grok web search
- Reviewed tweet from @openclaw announcing release
- Confirmed our WAL protocol and file-based memory are complementary to native fixes, not conflicting
- Nothing to remove or change in our setup

### SOUL.md Updated
- Added explicit brevity, humor, call-out, and swearing-when-it-lands rules per steipete's tweet
- Most of his recommendations we already had

### Bird CLI Auth Fix
- Bird reads Safari cookies, NOT Chrome — documented in TOOLS.md
- When auth fails: Marb refreshes x.com in Safari
