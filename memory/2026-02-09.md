# Daily Notes — February 9, 2026

## Red Rising Video Project Progress

### Book 2 Full Text Extracted
- Marb sent Golden Son epub (the earlier PDF was just a preview — 26 pages/16KB)
- Extracted via ebooklib+BeautifulSoup → 786K chars at `golden-son-book2-full.txt`
- Also sent a duplicate epub as backup (confirmed identical)

### Character Bible & Scenes Updated
- Spawned two agents to fill in Book 2 content
- Character bible: +10 new characters (Ragnar, Victra, Roque, Tactus, Lorn, Jackal, Aja, Kavax, Daxo, Lysander) + 6 existing updated
- Scene breakdowns: 12 scenes with exact quotes, replaced all [FULL TEXT NEEDED] placeholders
- Generated 4 PDFs and sent to Marb via Telegram

### Kling 3.0 Access Unlocked!
- Marb got Pro subscription → IMAGE 3.0 Omni + VIDEO 3.0 available
- Started generating Darrow (Red) reference images
- Gen 1: Too gaunt/waxy face (overloaded prompt)
- Gen 2: Much better with simplified prompt — locked right image as candidate
- Tested "Darrow from Red Rising" direct prompt — model doesn't know the character
- Image refinement tool has limited effect
- **Next: Generate Eo reference, then first video test**

### YELO Deck
- Marb asked for YELO feedback overview
- Shared from memory: dark palette good, but too uniform, no imagery, flat black, logo just "Y", no trust signals
- Direction: Quick Polish first, Full Redesign after

### Morning Report Delivered (7am)
- 3 bookmarks, 15 timeline posts, 14 GitHub repos, 27 news items
- Top: Opus 4.6 safety study, Mollick agent org theory, Qwen 3.5, Super Bowl AI chaos

## Proactive Work Session (3am)
- Scripted all 5 top Book 1 scenes (37 shots total) with full Kling 3.0 prompts
- Updated MEMORY.md with project details
- Refreshed PROACTIVE-IDEAS.md

## Evening Session: Backup & Portability System
Marb asked to set up backup so the workspace can be cloned to another device.

### Built
- **Nightly backup cron** (3am): auto-commits and pushes ~/clawd/ to GitHub
- **Setup script** (`~/clawd/scripts/setup-new-machine.sh`): one-command bootstrap for fresh Mac
- **.gitignore**: credentials, node_modules, large binaries, session data excluded

### Git Cleanup Issues
- First push blocked by large file (node_modules tracked in previous commits)
- Had to `git rm --cached` node_modules, epub files
- Still blocked: large file in git history
- Used `git filter-branch` to rewrite history and force-push clean
- Lesson: **Always set up .gitignore BEFORE first commit** — cleaning history is painful

### Shannon Pentester (from Feb 8 evening, continued)
- Installed to ~/clawd/tools/shannon/
- Docker-based, documented in TOOLS.md
- Not run against any targets yet

### Firecrawl SDK
- firecrawl-py v4.14.0 in .venv
- No API key configured yet

### Marketing Playbook Agent
- Created ~/clawd/agents/marketing-playbook.md (Greg Isenberg 5-step framework)
