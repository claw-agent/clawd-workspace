## 3:00 AM — Overnight Proactive Session

### 3D Landscaping Pipeline Deep Research
Picked the HIGH PRIORITY item from active.md. All proactive ideas were complete, so tackled this open item.

**Key findings:**
- **World Labs Marble has a full REST API** — supports panorama input natively (2:1 ratio required)
- API workflow: upload media asset → create generation → poll → get shareable 3D world URL
- **Nobody offers this for contractors** — Yardzen charges $2K-$5K for human+AI designs, no 3D walkthrough
- Pipeline: Teleport app (360° capture) → AI restaging → Marble (3D world) is technically sound
- **Gap:** The AI restaging step (NanoBanana) needs testing. Alternatives: our ComfyUI, REimagineHome, or direct img2img
- Proposed "Walk Your Dream Yard" as XPERIENCE upsell — free with roof job to close deals, or $99 standalone
- 3-phase implementation plan: manual POC → scripted pipeline → contractor self-service web app
- Integrates with all existing XPERIENCE systems (quote PDF, CRM, review gen)

**Files created:**
- `~/clawd/research/3d-landscaping-research.md` — full research (competitive analysis, API details, implementation plan)
- Updated `~/clawd/research/3d-landscaping-pipeline.md` — original pipeline doc (unchanged, still accurate)
- Updated PROACTIVE-IDEAS.md with completion

**Next steps (need Marb):**
1. Does XPERIENCE do landscaping or just roofing?
2. Test Teleport app on a real yard
3. Prototype with ComfyUI for AI restaging step

## Daytime — Quiet Sunday
- Marb asked about Xbox Discord/ProxChat mic routing for Arc Raiders gaming (helped troubleshoot "Switch to game chat" toggle)
- All automated systems ran clean: overnight swarm (43 items), morning report delivered, weekly maintenance (10 orphan sessions cleaned), 30-day trend report generated, tool update check (35 outdated brew packages, nothing critical)
- Weekly tech digest generated (Gemini 3 Deep Think V2, Anthropic $380B valuation, GLM-5, MiniMax M2.5)

## 10:30 PM — Compound Review
- No significant patterns/gotchas/preferences today — system running on autopilot
- Open items unchanged from active.md
- Feb 13 + 14 morning report reviews still waiting on Marb's voice notes
