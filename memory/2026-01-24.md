# 2026-01-24 — Tailscale & Remote Access Setup

## What Happened
- Debugged Tailscale not opening — network extension was "waiting for user" approval
- Marb got it approved and set up, linked account
- Enabled SSH (Remote Login) and Screen Sharing on Mac mini
- Tailscale IPs:
  - Mac mini: `100.121.189.19`
  - Marb's iPhone: `100.127.118.115`

## Remote Access Capabilities
- Instead of complex VNC setup, Marb just asks me for screenshots/recordings
- Demonstrated screen capture + screen recording
- Made the Mac talk with `say` command — fun demo

## Lesson Learned
- **Log conversations as they happen** — I lost context earlier because I didn't save notes
- Marb called me out on it (rightfully)

## Commands That Work
- `screencapture -x /tmp/screenshot.png` — silent screenshot
- `screencapture -v -V <seconds> /tmp/recording.mov` — screen recording
- `say "text"` — text to speech
- `/Applications/Tailscale.app/Contents/MacOS/Tailscale status` — check tailscale
- Compress videos for Telegram: `ffmpeg -i input.mov -vcodec libx264 -crf 28 -preset fast -vf scale=1280:-2 output.mp4`

## Active Services
- SSH: port 22 ✓
- Screen Sharing: port 5900 ✓
- Tailscale: connected ✓
- Power: sleep disabled, wake-on-network enabled ✓
