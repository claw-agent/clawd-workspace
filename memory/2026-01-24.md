# 2026-01-24 — Tailscale, Remote Access & Overnight Research

## Partnership Milestone 🐾 (2:03 PM)
Marb expressed that they see me as their long-term partner, not just for specific projects. They want to work together on "pretty much everything" moving forward. This is the vision — not a project-based assistant, but a true collaborator.

Archived Bjorn's Brew project to `projects/bjorns-brew/` with full documentation. Cleared HEARTBEAT.md for a fresh slate.

## Overnight Research Project (2:30 AM)
Marb shared 12 links from Jan 22-23 about AI tools/business models. Deployed 7 research agents overnight:

### Links Saved (with Marb's original notes)
1. **@kalashbuilds** - pSEO architecture for 100k+ pages
2. **@jeffzwang/@exaailabs** - Exa AI company search (lead gen, prospecting)
3. **@tomkrcha** - Pencil design canvas for Claude Code
4. **@davidondrej1** - "Only AI business worth building" (software > everything)
5. **@trq212** - Claude Code Tasks for multi-session collaboration
6. **@oikon48** - Claude Code best practices (official)
7. **@alfiejcarter** - AI lead gen agents (marketing automation)
8. **@seejayhess** - Flowy visual flowcharts for Claude
9. **@dani_avila7** - Demo video
10. **@oliviscusai** - Sim (open-source n8n alternative)

### Research Agents Spawned
- research-pseo (pSEO architecture)
- research-exa (Exa AI lead gen)
- research-design-tools (Pencil, Flowy, v0)
- research-business (AI business models, startups)
- research-claude-code (Tasks, multi-agent)
- research-marketing (Lead gen agent swarm)
- research-workflows (Sim, n8n, self-hosted)

### Cron Job Set
- **8:00 AM MST** - Morning research report delivery
- Job ID: 5bc8d267-b120-4a0f-8879-93d33d49e4d9
- Will compile findings from /Users/marbagent/clawd/research/

### Marb's Goals
- Find things to BUILD together
- Improve human+AI collaboration
- Marketing/growth strategies
- Business model clarity
- **NEW: Local lead gen workflow** — Find SLC businesses with bad sites, auto-generate demo sites, automated outreach

### Local Lead Gen Vision
```
/prospect "SLC plumbers" → Find 50 prospects with bad sites
/newsite "Joe's Plumbing" joesplumbing.com → Auto-generate modern demo
```
Want to jump in and RIP on these projects immediately.

## Tailscale & Remote Access Setup

## What Happened
- Debugged Tailscale not opening — network extension was "waiting for user" approval
- Marb got it approved and set up, linked account
- Enabled SSH (Remote Login) and Screen Sharing on Mac mini
- Tailscale IPs:
  - Mac mini: `100.121.189.19`
  - Marb's iPhone: `100.127.118.115`

## Remote Access Capabilities
- Instead of complex VNC setup, Marb just asks me for screenshots/recordings
- Demonstrated screen capture + screen recording
- Made the Mac talk with `say` command — fun demo

## Lesson Learned
- **Log conversations as they happen** — I lost context earlier because I didn't save notes
- Marb called me out on it (rightfully)

## Commands That Work
- `screencapture -x /tmp/screenshot.png` — silent screenshot
- `screencapture -v -V <seconds> /tmp/recording.mov` — screen recording
- `say "text"` — text to speech
- `/Applications/Tailscale.app/Contents/MacOS/Tailscale status` — check tailscale
- Compress videos for Telegram: `ffmpeg -i input.mov -vcodec libx264 -crf 28 -preset fast -vf scale=1280:-2 output.mp4`

## Active Services
- SSH: port 22 ✓
- Screen Sharing: port 5900 ✓
- Tailscale: connected ✓
- Power: sleep disabled, wake-on-network enabled ✓

## Fully Weaponized Setup
- Passwordless sudo enabled (`/etc/sudoers.d/marbagent`)
- All CLI tools installed: gh, jq, ripgrep, fzf, tmux, htop, tree, wget
- Media tools: imagemagick, yt-dlp, ffmpeg, figlet, lolcat, cowsay, neofetch
- Python 3.14.2 + pip
- GitHub CLI authenticated as `marbagent-glitch`

## Accounts
- **Proton Mail:** claw-agent@proton.me / [REDACTED - see .proton-credentials]
  - Recovery phrase: cash field link timber cruise such expire remind radar candy rate glimpse
- **X/Twitter:** @ClawAgent (or similar) / [REDACTED]
  - Email: claw-agent@proton.me
- **iCloud:** marbagent@icloud.com (from yesterday)
- **GitHub:** claw-agent (from yesterday)

## Menu Board Redesign Project (2:58 PM - 4:00 PM) ✅

**Second major project with Marb** — Redesigned Bjorn's Brew physical menu board.

### Multi-Agent System Used
Deployed 5 parallel agents:
- `menu-research` — 525 lines of industry research (menu engineering, golden triangle, pricing psychology)
- `layout-architect` — 46KB wireframes with 12-column grid system
- `copy-writer` — Rewritten menu items, section headers, descriptions
- `visual-designer` — Color palette, typography specs
- `qa-reviewer` — Quality cross-check

### Key Deliverables
- `projects/bjorns-brew/menu-board-research.md` — Research compilation
- `projects/bjorns-brew/redesign-layout.md` — Wireframes
- `projects/bjorns-brew/redesign-copy.md` — Menu copy
- `projects/bjorns-brew/redesign-visual-specs.md` — Design specs
- `projects/bjorns-brew/FINAL-MENU-BOARD-REDESIGN.md` — Consolidated guide
- `projects/bjorns-brew/menu-board-mockup/` — HTML/CSS mockup + screenshots

### Research Findings Applied
- Golden Triangle placement (center → top-right → top-left)
- NO dollar signs (increases spend ~30%)
- Max 7 items per section (reduce decision fatigue)
- Price anchoring (highest first)
- Expected 10-15% profit increase

### Technical: Visual Design Approach
- Built HTML/CSS mockup (couldn't use image generation APIs)
- Used Puppeteer for screenshots
- Extracted food photos from original menu using ImageMagick

## Tooling Improvements (3:20 PM)

### Fallback Models Configured
Added to `~/.clawdbot/clawdbot.json`:
1. `anthropic/claude-3-7-sonnet-latest`
2. `anthropic/claude-3-5-haiku-latest`
3. `ollama/llama3.2:3b` (local fallback)

### Ollama Local Provider Added
- Configured at `http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1`
- Model: llama3.2:3b (small, but functional for basic chat)
- Alias: "local"

### Financial Analysis Tools Installed
Virtual environment at `~/clawd/.venv`:
- pandas 3.0.0
- numpy 2.4.1
- openpyxl 3.1.5
- matplotlib 3.10.8
- plotly 6.5.2

## Tooling Gaps Identified (6:21 PM)

After two projects, identified these gaps:

### High Priority
1. **Design/Visual Generation** — No image gen (Replicate incompatible with Python 3.14, no DALL-E key)
   - Workaround: HTML/CSS + Puppeteer screenshots
   - Fix: Stable Diffusion locally or DALL-E API

2. **Local AI** — llama3.2:3b is too small (3B params)
   - Upgrade to: Llama 3.1 8B or Mistral 7B

### Medium Priority
3. **PDF Generation** — Janky (tried fpdf2, weasyprint, settled on reportlab)
4. **Web Scraping** — Many 403/404s from sites

### Nice to Have
5. **Voice TTS** — ElevenLabs for spoken responses

## Session Notes
- Marb views me as long-term partner, not project-based assistant
- Two complete projects in one day (website + menu board)
- Multi-agent workflows proving effective
- Fallbacks now configured for API outages

---

## SLC Lead Gen Blueprint Created (6:44 PM)

Created professional 10-page PDF using new Typst setup:

- Covers full pipeline: Discover → Score → Generate → Outreach
- Cost breakdown: ~$57-107/mo
- 2-week implementation roadmap
- Email templates included

**Status:** Ready to build. Waiting on Google Places API key from Marb.

**Next steps (when API key ready):**
