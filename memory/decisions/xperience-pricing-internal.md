# XPERIENCE pricing tool is internal only
**Date:** 2026-02-12
**Context:** Built the pricing estimator for Jamie the contractor. Question arose whether to make it consumer-facing.
**Decision:** Internal tool for the contractor, not consumer-facing. More data, no consumer fluff.
**Rationale:** Jamie needs accurate estimates for quoting jobs. Consumers need marketing, not raw numbers. Different audiences = different tools.
