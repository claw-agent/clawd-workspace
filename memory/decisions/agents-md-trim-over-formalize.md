# Decision: Trim AGENTS.md Rather Than Add More Process
**Date:** 2026-02-17
**Context:** Research suggested verbose agent instructions hurt performance

Chose to trim ~500 chars from AGENTS.md (removed Work Style redundancies with SOUL.md, killed Group Chats section, collapsed Safety/Formatting) rather than adding more structure. Verbose instructions cause agents to focus on process compliance over task completion.

**Rationale:** Less instruction → better output. SOUL.md already covers tone/style, no need to repeat in AGENTS.md.
