# Morning reports: PDF + text only, no voice
**Date:** 2026-02-12
**Context:** Voice brief was unreliable (TTS timeouts, chunking OOM, audio quality inconsistent). Marb found it more frustrating than useful.
**Decision:** Kill voice brief permanently. Morning reports = PDF attachment + text summary in Telegram.
**Rationale:** PDF is reliable and scannable. Voice added complexity with negative ROI.
