# Decision: Mitte AI as Seedance 2.0 Access Point

**Date:** 2026-02-19
**Context:** Looking for frame-by-frame video gen control for Red Rising creative project + potential XPERIENCE ad automation
**Decision:** Pursue Mitte AI's "Omni mode" for Seedance 2.0 JSON-controlled video generation
**Reasoning:**
- JSON prompts give per-shot control (lens, lighting, camera, timing) — far more precise than Dreamina text prompts or ChatCut scripts
- Solves our biggest problem: character consistency across shots
- Red Rising pipeline: Midjourney refs → JSON storyboard → Seedance 2 via Mitte → post-production
- Also applicable to XPERIENCE: templated storm-triggered video ads
**Status:** Pending — needs manual signup (JS SPA), Seedance 2 requires Pro/Power tier
