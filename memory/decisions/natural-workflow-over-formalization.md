# Decision: Keep Natural Workflows, Don't Over-Formalize
**Date:** 2026-02-17
**Context:** GSD spec-driven dev article suggested formalizing all work into specs

Decided to keep specs organic — use SPEC.md when builds are complex enough (like pricing tool) but don't mandate it for everything. Morning report reviews already serve as natural "setup review" cycles without dedicated cron.

**Rationale:** Premature formalization adds overhead without value. Let patterns emerge naturally.
