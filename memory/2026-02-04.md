## Major Debugging Session
Long session with Marb fixing system instability. Key outcomes:

### Root Causes Fixed
- Dual-response: config.schema dumping 200KB
- Context bloat: Set 120k cap (was unlimited)
- TTS timeouts: Moved to 6am compile phase
- web_search: Disabled (never had API key)
- Session cleanup: Script + cleaned old 3-6MB transcripts

### Architecture Problems Identified
1. Web search silently failing (no Brave key)
2. Task promises not persisting across sessions
3. Subagent reliability issues (3/4 timed out during XPERIENCE research)
4. Complexity creep — each fix adds more scripts/cron/monitoring

### XPERIENCE Research
Did manually after subagents failed. Brief at `research/xperience/QUICK-BRIEF-2026-02-04.md`
- Storm chaser company going legit
- Thursday pitch meeting
- Lead gen automation opportunity

### Decision Pending
Marb frustrated with debugging loop. Considering:
- Simplify (strip complexity)
- Fix properly (systematic architecture fixes)
- Pause (step back)

### Marb's Mood
Tired of debugging. Wants ROOT fixes, not symptom patches. Wants to use existing tools properly before adding new ones.

## Lessons
- Subagents unreliable for time-sensitive research — do it manually
- Check if tools actually have required credentials before relying on them
- 120k context cap good tradeoff (forces compaction before slowdown)
