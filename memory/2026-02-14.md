## Morning Report Reviews (9:30am - 4:30pm)
Marb reviewing last 3 morning reports via voice notes. Started with Feb 12.

### Feb 12 Report Review — COMPLETE

- PDFs sent via Telegram

Key findings:
- **3D Landscaping for XPERIENCE** — first-mover opportunity, HIGH PRIORITY
- **SEO Powerstack** — cataloged, don't activate yet
- **Outbound system** — cataloged, don't activate yet
- **"Tool Shaped Objects"** — framework for evaluating AI tools
- **McKinsey prompt** — transferable to Claude for consulting reports
- **Claude Code 101** — keep instructions under 150-200 lines, add WHY not WHAT

## 10:30 PM Compound Review
Quiet day. Core value delivered through morning report + deep Feb 12 review. Feb 13/14 reviews still queued. XPERIENCE systems growing (quote gen added to pricing tool, storm monitor, review gen).
