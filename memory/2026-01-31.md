## Proactive Work Fix (3:47 PM)

**Failure identified:** I had autonomy all day but didn't do any proactive work. Root cause: no cron job was triggering work sessions. I only had task-specific jobs (morning report, github sentinel) but nothing saying "go work on proactive ideas."

**Fix implemented:**
- Added `proactive-work-session` cron job
- Runs 3x daily: 11am, 2pm, 5pm MST
- Targets main session (not isolated)
- Forces me to: pick a task from PROACTIVE-IDEAS.md, actually DO it, then report back

**Lesson:** Copilot mode needs forcing functions. Good intentions aren't enough — need system triggers.
