## Twitter Bookmark System Fixed (4:00 PM) ✅

### Problem
- Screenshot+browser approach was only getting 8 bookmarks
- Lost links, videos, threads, context
- Marb has 50+ bookmarks needing analysis

### Solution: bird CLI
- `bird bookmarks --all --json` — fetches ALL bookmarks with full metadata
- Full JSON: text, links, media URLs (including video!), threads, quoted tweets, engagement
- Uses Safari cookies (required Full Disk Access for Terminal)

### Setup Required
1. Marb logged into x.com in Safari
2. Granted Terminal "Full Disk Access" in System Settings
3. Created `~/.config/bird/config.json5` for persistent config

### Results
- **123 bookmarks** captured (vs 8 before)
- Full metadata preserved
- Saved to: `~/clawd/memory/bookmarks-full-20260128.json`

### Lesson Learned
When facing bot detection/rate limits, use cliclick to act human (mouse movements, natural typing) instead of hammering APIs. Marb's feedback: "act like a human not robot."

### Credentials Update
- X password stored: `~/clawd/config/.x-credentials`
- Updated MEMORY.md with credential tracking table
- Pattern for future: always use credential files, never plain text in memory

## ClawdHub Skills Deep Dive (4:30 PM - 4:45 PM) ✅

### Skills Installed (11 new)
| Skill | Purpose | Status |
|-------|---------|--------|
| deep-research | Multi-step research (uses external API) | Installed, won't use - our research-swarm is better |
| abm-outbound | Full sales automation pipeline | ✅ Ready for lead gen |
| youtube-transcript | Video transcripts without download | ✅ Use in Scout Alpha |
| google-workspace-mcp | Gmail/Calendar/Drive | Needs OAuth setup |
| apollo-enrichment | Email/phone lookup | Needs business email signup |
| linkedin | LinkedIn automation | ✅ Ready via browser |
| proactive-agent | Proactive AI patterns | ✅ Merge into AGENTS.md |
| mlx-whisper | Apple Silicon STT | ✅ Use for transcription |
| remotion-best-practices | Video rendering rules | ✅ Reference for video work |
| email | Email sending | Works with google-workspace |

### Key Decisions
1. **Keep research-swarm** — deep-research requires external Crafted API, ours is local and better
2. **Keep Qwen3-TTS** — mlx-whisper is for STT only, Qwen for TTS
3. **Keep youtube approach for visual analysis** — transcript skill for text-only needs
4. **Apollo deferred** — Marb will set up with business email later

### Patterns to Adopt from proactive-agent
- Curiosity loops (learning more about Marb over time)
- Pattern recognition (systematize recurring requests)
- Outcome tracking (track what worked)
- Security audit scripts

### ABM-Outbound Pipeline (for SLC Lead Gen + Tapflow)
```
LinkedIn URLs → Apify scrape → Apollo enrich → Skip trace → Multi-channel outreach
                                (email/phone)   (address)   (Email + LinkedIn + Letters)
```
Way more sophisticated than our demo-site approach. Use together.
