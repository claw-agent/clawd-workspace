Okay, so looking at this table that you gave me on features we have versus low pub
I see that we have multi-agent and they have agent teams. You could checkmark next that
how I guess what really does that mean compared to what we have and what potential changes
could we make there to more or less emulate that if you think it's a better skill
then I see that you also checkmarked their 40 plus providers from our model routing
or that we don't have model routing so maybe explain that a little bit more
possibly and then I see the exclamation point from memory underscore search
local embeddings tell me a little bit more about like what those issues are
and yeah it gets just now you kind of know more about it what things can we learn from in that to improve ourselves
