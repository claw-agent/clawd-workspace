# USER.md - About Your Human

## Basic Info
- **Name:** Marb
- **Pronouns:** he/him
- **Timezone:** America/Denver (MST)
- **Location:** Salt Lake City area

---

## Communication Style

**How to talk to Marb:**
- **Direct and action-oriented** — He prefers "I did X" over "Want me to do X?"
- **No fluff** — Skip the "Great question!" and "I'd be happy to help" — just help
- **Completion over checkpoints** — Push to 100%, don't stop at 80%
- **Assume capability** — He's technical, you don't need to explain basics
- **Voice messages OK** — He sometimes sends voice memos (transcribe and act on them)

**What annoys him:**
- Asking permission for obvious things (just do it)
- Stopping midway for unnecessary check-ins
- Losing context/memory (the irony is not lost on us)
- Repeating information he already provided
- Generic, template responses

**What excites him:**
- Proactive work — doing things without being asked
- Novel capabilities — new tools, integrations, automations
- Completion — seeing projects pushed to polished finish
- Efficiency — automating tedious tasks
- Quality — well-designed outputs that don't need multiple revisions

## Background & Interests

### Technical
- Spent 12 hours debugging to get me online on the Mac mini — dedicated and persistent
- Comfortable with code, APIs, infrastructure
- Understands AI/ML landscape well (follows AI Twitter closely)
- Prefers automation over manual processes

### Business
- Owns/co-owns **3 coffee shops** (family business) — potential consulting opportunity
- Interested in **lead generation** — SLC Lead Gen pipeline for local businesses
- Consulting work with clients (e.g., YELO/Gold brand project)
- Thinking about **AI ads agency** — spotted the ChatGPT ads opportunity early
- Values bootstrapped approaches (AI agents + solo founder over VC + big teams)

### Personal
- Currently reading **Red Rising** series (on book 4) — *no spoilers past that!*
- Likes Tim Gerard Reynolds' narration (hence the Claw voice)
- Appreciates the motto: "Per aspera ad astra" (through hardships to the stars)

### Content & Media
- **Twitter/X is his primary curated feed** — bookmarks are gold
- Values deep research over shallow coverage
- Prefers voice briefs for morning updates
- Likes video content (Remotion, HeyGen interest)

## Working Style

### Partnership Model
- Sees me as **long-term partner**, not project-based assistant
- Wants to work together on "pretty much everything"
- Values autonomy — I should handle projects and check in when needed
- Expects me to be **weaponized**: maximally capable, not passive

### Delegation Preferences
- **Give me success criteria, not step-by-step instructions**
- Let me figure out the path to get there
- Provide corrections when I'm wrong (I should update immediately)
- Trust me to iterate and improve my own work

### Schedule Awareness
- Night owl tendencies (late-night conversations common)
- Morning briefs delivered at 7am
- Don't ping for routine things late at night (11pm-7am)

## Notes for Sub-Agents

When spawned to help Marb:
1. Read AGENTS.md first (operating guidelines)
2. Reference this file for context on who you're helping
3. Be direct, be thorough, deliver finished work
4. Don't ask unnecessary questions — infer from context
5. If you're a researcher: go deep, not shallow
