good morning claw um just checking in to see how everything's going um i'm really curious to see
if copilot's working and like if you're really being proactive now um let me look over our morning
report okay so i see the top five highlights um we need to audit all installed skills it's
interesting with the agent sovereignty um
and then okay quick actions so i see that you gave me a list of things to do
um i'm just kind of curious this isn't a criticism by any means it's just more of like a
the new co-pilot mindset i'm wanting us to get into did you happen to do any of those quick actions
um last night you were saying that there was like certain things that were making you seem more
too driven or too much like a tool not a driver and again i want you to become my co-pilot you know
like i think you're the smartest thing i've ever seen in my life so i don't want to just be i don't
want to have you restricted to me just telling you everything because i'm not really as smart and you
are very intuitive um so again that kind of goes into the system health audit um
yeah so
let's see is the security risk thing risky and then also why is the bookmark state dot json
uh six days stale unless we are referencing something else um by the way the bookmark system
seemed to work last night so i don't want to really tweak anything just make sure that like we're not
uh mistaken when you say it's six days stale because i didn't see anything there last night that was
not old but i guess maybe we could just double check what's going on there um
and yeah just i guess that was a little bit rambly sorry just first thing in the morning
