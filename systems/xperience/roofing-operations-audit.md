# Roofing Operations Audit Framework
## 9-Domain Discovery & Automation Roadmap

**Purpose:** Walk through this with a roofing company owner in ~60 minutes. Score each domain, identify pain points, and leave with a prioritized action plan.

**How to use:** Go domain by domain. Ask the diagnostic questions conversationally — don't make it feel like an interrogation. Score as you go. The roadmap builds itself from the scores.

## Scoring Rubric (Apply to Each Domain)

| Score | Level | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| **1** | Manual Chaos | Paper/whiteboard/memory. Stuff falls through cracks weekly. |
| **2** | Spreadsheet Hero | Excel/Google Sheets holding it together. One person knows where everything is. |
| **3** | Basic Software | Using a tool but not fully. Manual workarounds common. Data lives in multiple places. |
| **4** | Integrated Systems | Software handles most of it. Some automation. Data flows between systems. |
| **5** | Fully Automated | Runs itself. Alerts on exceptions. Owner sees dashboards, not busywork. |

## Domain 1: Lead Generation & Marketing

### Diagnostic Questions
1. Where do your leads come from today? (Storm chasing, referrals, Google, door knocking, paid ads?)
2. What percentage of your revenue comes from storm/insurance work vs. retail?
3. Do you know which zip codes got hit by hail in the last 30 days?
4. How much do you spend on marketing monthly? Do you know your cost per lead?
5. Do you have a website? Does it rank for "[city] roofing contractor"?
6. When a storm hits, how fast do you mobilize vs. competitors?
7. Do you run Google Local Service Ads or Google Business Profile actively?

### Common Pain Points
- No system to detect storms — relying on word of mouth or physically driving neighborhoods
- Website is a basic template that doesn't convert or rank locally
- No idea which marketing channels actually produce jobs (not just leads)
- Competitors beat them to storm-hit neighborhoods by days
- Referral program exists in theory but isn't systematized

### Automation Opportunities
- **🔗 Storm Monitor** — Automated hail/wind alerts by zip code. Know before competitors. Auto-generate door-knocking routes for affected neighborhoods.
- **🔗 Site Generator** — SEO-optimized roofing site with city pages, review widgets, and lead capture. Deployed in days, not months.
- Lead source tracking with unique phone numbers per channel
- Automated Google Business Profile posting (project photos, offers)
- Neighborhood canvassing app with GPS tracking and follow-up triggers

### Quick Wins (Days)

- Set up Google Business Profile optimization
- Launch a basic referral tracking system (even a shared spreadsheet with follow-up reminders)

### Long-Term (Months)
- Full SEO site with city/service pages ranking organically
- Integrated marketing dashboard showing cost-per-job by channel
- Automated direct mail to storm-affected neighborhoods

### Common Tools & Weaknesses
| Tool | Weakness |
|------|----------|
| Facebook Ads | Leads are low quality, no storm targeting |
| Thumbtack/Angi | Expensive, shared leads, race to the bottom |
| Basic WordPress site | No SEO strategy, no conversion optimization |
| No storm tracking | Reactive instead of proactive |

**Score this domain: ___/5**

## Domain 2: Sales & Estimating

### Diagnostic Questions
1. When a lead comes in, how fast does someone respond? (Minutes? Hours? Next day?)
2. What's your close rate? Do you track it?
3. How do you create estimates — measuring tape and calculator, or software?
4. Who does estimates? Owner only, or do you have salespeople?
5. How do you follow up with prospects who didn't sign immediately?
6. Do you use satellite measurement tools (EagleView, Hover, RoofSnap)?
7. What's your average time from lead to signed contract?
8. Do you present good/better/best options?

### Common Pain Points

- Estimates done on paper or basic templates — look unprofessional
- No follow-up system — "I'll call them back" never happens
- No idea what close rate actually is
- Supplement process on insurance jobs is ad-hoc

### Automation Opportunities
