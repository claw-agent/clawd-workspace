I don't really want you to do anything until we really figure out this whole context problem.
Like, this is the biggest issue that we have right now.
And I thought we got it fixed, but we really need to have this whole thing working.
Like, why did it drop context right in the middle?
That's what I want to figure out.
Like, I know you have the context now, but I don't want this to keep dropping off and then have it go off on a side tangent.
And we have to remind you every time when context isn't correct.
Like, again, I said I want to spend all the time figuring out how to have perfect memory without having this context drop.
And so if we need to hit the drawing board again there, then that's fine.
But let's really dig deep and find out what's going on with this problem.
