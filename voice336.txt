Okay, perfect, thank you. So, what's gonna happen now is he's gonna send me the repository of the
Moonwalk Fitness app, and basically my job is I'm supposed to go in and more or less try to fix a
lot of shit, and so this spans from everything from like UI, UX, to optimization, to just layout,
to user flows, to everything, and so is this something that we're capable of doing? Like,
do we have all the right tools and skills and everything ready, all the right agents,
and just everything that we need? I'd love for us to be able to crush this, it would be awesome.
