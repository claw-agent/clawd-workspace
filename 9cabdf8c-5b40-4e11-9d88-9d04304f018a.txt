Yeah, you said it at the end, but to me it looks like from the main word flow.
I'll like the best practices article that you send.
It shows like nanobinana and then the other versions, even mid journey slash flux.
But it seems like we have two of the pretty key prongs here.
We've got the Quen 3 for the clone or design custom voices in the Hagen avatar.
But we don't really have the tooling to make the first round like custom images and stuff.
I guess maybe it's time to start looking into mid journey or flux or banana or nanobinana pro.
And then I do see the alternative or cheaper stack and again, same thing.
We kind of have everything there and I wonder if we could even use remotion here.
But yeah, let me know what you think here.
