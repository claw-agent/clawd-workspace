One idea I had for us losing context mid-session, even though we have the ability to recover memory now,
would be if we should write in the morning or like in the evening or whenever you think is the most
astute time, but have a job that just starts a new session. That way there's no really persistent
session context that we need to refer to right when we wake up and you can just basically store
everything and have it all ready to go for the morning with like new context.
