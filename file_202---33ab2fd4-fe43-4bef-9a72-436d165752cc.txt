Yeah, I guess what I would maybe ask is like, what do you think is going on?
Because like intuition tells me something is really going on and we're,
we're beating around the bush with a bunch of symptoms, but my guess would be that there's
got to be something with the way that we have built things out in the past or fixed that might
just be like lingering or persistent that are causing a lot of errors. And you're saying we
dumped a lot of text in this session, config twice, cron jobs, memory files, all these things.
Oh, you're just saying that it should be getting chunky. Okay. That's fine.
Um, yeah, I guess just like, what is your, what are your guesses here? I literally
can't figure these things out. Also, I thought we uninstalled the brave API key thing that you're
saying is a known issue. Um, and I thought we basically said we're not going to use that anymore.
So that's just another random aside, but, um,
I'm just very curious what's going on here.
