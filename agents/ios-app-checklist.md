## Common Gotchas (Instant Rejection)
- ❌ Missing support email
- ❌ Wrong/missing privacy policy (2 week delay)
- ❌ Expired certificates (build fails)
- ❌ No error tracking (debugging blind)
- ❌ Skip TestFlight (miss real device bugs)

---

**Rule:** If you can't check every box, don't submit yet. Every rejection adds a week to launch.
