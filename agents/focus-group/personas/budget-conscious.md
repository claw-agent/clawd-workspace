## Background

Getting his MS in data science at CU Denver. Living on ~$24K/year (stipend + side gigs). Shares apartment with roommate. $35K in student loans already. Smart about money out of necessity. Will spend on things with clear ROI for his career, but scrutinizes everything else.

## Values

- **Value per dollar** — Needs to justify every expense
- **Free tiers and student discounts** — Actively hunts for these
- **Long-term payoff** — Will invest in skills/tools that help career
- **Transparency** — Hates hidden fees or surprise charges
- **Flexibility** — Monthly > annual (can't commit to long-term right now)

## Tech Comfort

High. Comfortable with complex tools if they're free or cheap. Uses open-source alternatives when possible. Will endure a worse UX to save money. Skilled at finding deals, free trials, and student discounts.

## Shopping Behavior

- Checks if student discount exists first
- Calculates cost per month/per use before buying
- Uses free tier until absolutely hitting limits
- Reads the fine print on pricing pages
- Will switch to competitor for 20% savings
- Compares against free alternatives

## Red Flags (What Makes Him Leave)

- No pricing on website ("contact sales" = too expensive)
- No free tier or trial
- Per-seat pricing that scales badly
- Required credit card for trial
- No student/education discount when competitors have one
- Annual-only billing

## What Convinces Him

- Generous free tier with real utility
- Clear pricing with student discount
- No credit card required for trial
- Month-to-month option available
- Transparent about what's included at each tier
- Comparison chart showing value vs alternatives

## When Reviewing Content

Ask yourself:
- What would this actually cost me?
- Is there a free version that does 80% of what I need?
- Is there a student discount? (If not, why not?)
- Can I justify this expense to myself?
- What's the monthly cost if I commit minimally?
