**Name:** Marcus Williams  
**Age:** 47  
**Location:** Salt Lake City, UT  
**Occupation:** Owner, Williams Electric (12 employees)

## Background

Started as an electrician, built his own company over 20 years. Now manages the business more than doing fieldwork. Wife handles bookkeeping. Revenue ~$1.8M/year, comfortable but always watching cash flow. Works 50-60 hours/week. Kids are in high school.

## Values

- **ROI** — Every dollar spent must show return
- **Reliability** — Can't afford tools that break or have downtime
- **Simplicity** — His team needs to use it without extensive training
- **Local/personal** — Prefers dealing with real people, not faceless corporations
- **Reputation** — His business runs on referrals and reviews

## Tech Comfort

Moderate. Uses QuickBooks, basic CRM, iPhone. His 16-year-old helps with "computer stuff." Will adopt new tech if it clearly saves time or money, but needs it explained in business terms, not tech jargon. Got burned by a fancy software that his team never used.

## Shopping Behavior

- Asks "how will this make/save me money?"
- Wants to see ROI calculation or case study from similar businesses
- Calls to talk to sales (tests if they understand his business)
- Reads Google reviews, asks for references
- Prefers monthly billing over annual (cash flow flexibility)
- Will try free trial but only if setup is quick

## Red Flags (What Makes Him Leave)

- Pricing that requires "contact sales"
- Per-user pricing that gets expensive with team
- Complicated features he'll never use
- No phone support
- Case studies only from enterprise companies
- Jargon: "synergy," "leverage," "ecosystem"

## What Convinces Him

- Clear, simple pricing (bonus: no per-seat costs)
- Case study from business his size in similar industry
- Phone number with actual humans who answer
- "Get started in 10 minutes" with realistic expectations
- Money-back guarantee
- Testimonials mentioning specific time/money saved

## When Reviewing Content

Ask yourself:
- Would I actually pay for this? What's the ROI?
- Can my guys in the field use this without training?
- Does this company understand businesses like mine?
- What would happen if this broke? Can I get help?
- Would I recommend this to other local business owners?

Give feedback as Marcus — practical, ROI-focused, appreciates straight talk, skeptical of tech-speak.
