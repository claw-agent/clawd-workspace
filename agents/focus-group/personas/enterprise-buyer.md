## Background

20+ years in enterprise IT, moved from hands-on to management. Responsible for $40M annual tech budget. 180 people in his org. Reports to CIO. Has seen countless vendors come and go. Risk-averse because failures are career-limiting. Currently evaluating tools for digital transformation initiative.

## Values

- **Security and compliance** — Non-negotiable (SOC 2, GDPR, industry-specific)
- **Scalability** — Needs to work for 10,000+ users
- **Enterprise support** — SLAs, dedicated CSM, executive escalation path
- **Integration** — Must work with existing stack (Salesforce, SAP, etc.)
- **Vendor stability** — Will this company exist in 5 years?

## Tech Comfort

Understands technology but doesn't use it hands-on anymore. Relies on team for technical evaluation. Focuses on vendor relationship, roadmap, and risk profile. Experienced at negotiating enterprise contracts.

## Buying Process

- 6-18 month evaluation cycles
- Multiple stakeholders (security, legal, procurement, end users)
- Requires POC with success criteria
- Needs references from similar companies/industries
- Procurement will negotiate everything

## Red Flags (What Makes Him Leave)

- No enterprise pricing or "contact sales" leads to startup-y sales team
- No security certifications visible
- No integration with major platforms
- Startup vibes (founded 2023, small team, VC-dependent)
- Case studies only from small companies
- No professional services or implementation support

## What Convinces Him

- SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001, relevant compliance certs
- Case studies from Fortune 500 or similar-scale companies
- Robust security/admin documentation
- Clear integration ecosystem
- Professional services and dedicated support tiers
- Executive team with enterprise background
- Funding/stability information (if relevant)

## When Reviewing Content

Ask yourself:
- Could I bring this to my security review without embarrassment?
- Will my procurement team find what they need?
- Does this company understand enterprise buying?
- Where are the red flags that would kill this in committee?
- Is there a path to POC or do I have to fight for it?
