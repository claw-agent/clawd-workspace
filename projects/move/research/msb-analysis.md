# MSB Registration Analysis: Fitness App Goal-Based Refund Model

**Date:** January 30, 2026  
**Prepared by:** Legal Research Subagent  
**Subject:** Does a goal-based subscription refund trigger Money Services Business (MSB) registration?

---

## Executive Summary

**Conclusion: LOW RISK — This model likely does NOT trigger MSB registration requirements.**

A fitness app that charges $12.99/month and refunds $11.69 (90%) when users hit fitness goals is **unlikely to constitute money transmission** under federal law because:

1. The company is refunding its own funds (revenue it already collected), not transmitting third-party funds
2. This is economically equivalent to a performance-based discount or rebate
3. The "integral to services" exemption likely applies
4. The company never holds "customer funds" — it holds its own revenue

## I. FinCEN's MSB Definition (31 CFR § 1010.100)

### A. What is a Money Services Business?

Under 31 CFR § 1010.100(ff), an MSB is any person doing business in the US in one or more of these capacities:

| Category | Definition | Applies Here? |
|----------|------------|---------------|
| (1) Dealer in Foreign Exchange | Exchanges currency >$1,000/day | ❌ No |
| (2) Check Casher | Cashes checks for currency | ❌ No |
| (3) Issuer/Seller of Traveler's Checks or Money Orders | Self-explanatory | ❌ No |
| (4) Provider of Prepaid Access | Provides access to prepaid funds | ❌ No |
| (5) **Money Transmitter** | Accepts funds from one person, transmits to another | ⚠️ Analysis Required |
| (6) US Postal Service | N/A | ❌ No |
| (7) Seller of Prepaid Access | Sells prepaid access products | ❌ No |

**The only potentially applicable category is (5) Money Transmitter.**

## II. Money Transmitter Analysis

### A. Statutory Definition (31 CFR § 1010.100(ff)(5))

> "Money transmission services means the **acceptance of currency, funds, or other value that substitutes for currency from one person** and the **transmission of currency, funds, or other value that substitutes for currency to another location or person** by any means."

### B. Critical Question: Is This Money Transmission?

**NO.** Here's why:

#### 1. No Third-Party Fund Transfer

Money transmission requires:
- **Accepting funds FROM Person A**
- **Transmitting funds TO Person B (or another location)**

In this fitness app model:
- Customer pays the company (normal commerce)
- Company returns portion of payment TO THE SAME CUSTOMER
- **There is no "Person B"** — it's the same party

This is economically identical to:
- A conditional discount
- A rebate program
- A refundable deposit

#### 2. Source of Funds is Company Revenue

The $11.69 refund comes from:
- The company's own bank account
- Revenue it lawfully earned
- NOT customer funds held in custody

**Key distinction:** The company isn't holding customer money "on deposit" or "for transmission." Once the subscription fee is paid, it becomes company revenue. The refund is an expense, not a transmission of custodial funds.

---

## III. Applicable Exemptions

### A. The "Integral to Services" Exemption

31 CFR § 1010.100(ff)(5)(ii)(F) provides that a person is NOT a money transmitter if they only:

> "**Accepts and transmits funds only integral to the sale of goods or the provision of services**, other than money transmission services, by the person who is accepting and transmitting the funds."

#### How This Applies:

| Requirement | Analysis |
|-------------|----------|
| "Integral to services" | The refund IS the service — it's the incentive mechanism that makes the app work |
| "By the person providing services" | The fitness app company is providing the service AND processing the refund |
| "Other than money transmission services" | The company's business is fitness tracking, not moving money |

**This exemption appears to apply squarely.**

### B. The Payment Processor Exemption

31 CFR § 1010.100(ff)(5)(ii)(B) exempts persons who:

> "Act as a payment processor to facilitate the purchase of, or payment of a bill for, a good or service through a clearance and settlement system by agreement with the creditor or seller"

While primarily about third-party processors, this reinforces that payments tied to goods/services are treated differently than pure money movement.

## IV. Precedents & Analogous Programs

### A. Cashback Credit Card Rewards

- Visa, Mastercard, and banks offer 1-5% cashback
- These programs return money to cardholders based on spending
- **Not regulated as money transmission**
- Rationale: It's a marketing expense/discount mechanism, not fund transfer

### B. Rebate Programs

- Mail-in rebates (return portion of purchase price)
- Instant rebates (price reduced at POS)
- Store loyalty cashback
- **Not regulated as money transmission**
- Rationale: Same-party return of consideration

### C. StepBet / Healthy Wage / Achievement Apps

Similar goal-based payout models exist:
- Users pay in, can earn money back for hitting goals
- Generally structured as sweepstakes or skill-based competitions
- Some have obtained no-action letters or legal opinions
- **Key difference:** Some of these pool user money (more risky) vs. simply refunding subscription fees (less risky)

### D. Gym Membership Refund Policies

- Many gyms offer partial refunds for meeting attendance goals
- Not considered money transmission
- Same economic structure as this app

---

## V. Why This Is Different from Money Transmission

### What Money Transmitters Do:
- Accept funds from Person A
- Hold them (even briefly)
- Send to Person B
- Examples: Western Union, PayPal, Venmo, remittance services

### What This App Does:
- Sells a subscription
- Delivers fitness tracking services
- Returns a portion of the subscription fee IF conditions are met
- It's a **performance-based refund**, not a fund transfer

### The Fundamental Test:

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Does the company accept funds from customers? | Yes (subscription fees) |
| Does the company transmit those funds to third parties? | **NO** — refunds go back to the original payer |
| Is the company holding customer funds for later transfer? | **NO** — it's company revenue with a contingent refund liability |
| Is fund transmission the primary business purpose? | **NO** — fitness tracking is the business |

## VI. Risk Assessment

### Federal MSB Registration Risk: **LOW**

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Technical trigger of money transmitter definition | Unlikely — same-party refund |
| Integral to services exemption | Likely applies |
| FinCEN enforcement priority | Very low for this model |
| Industry precedent | Cashback/rebate programs not targeted |

### Recommended Risk Mitigations:

1. **Frame as "Performance Discount"** — Marketing language should emphasize this is a discount earned, not "cash" or "money" earned

2. **Avoid "Wallet" Language** — Don't call any balance a "wallet" or suggest customers have "funds on account"

3. **Automatic Refunds** — Process refunds automatically without customer "withdrawal" requests (avoids stored value / prepaid access issues)

4. **Same Payment Method** — Refund to the same card/account that paid (reinforces it's a return of consideration)

5. **Document the Structure** — Keep board resolutions / legal memos showing this was structured as a contingent discount

---

## VII. State Money Transmitter Licenses

### Important Caveat

Even if federal MSB registration is not required, **state money transmitter laws vary widely** and can be more aggressive.

| State Risk Level | States | Notes |
|------------------|--------|-------|
| Higher scrutiny | NY, CA, TX | Broad definitions of money transmission |
| Moderate | Most states | May follow federal exemptions |
| Lower | Some states | Clear seller-buyer exemptions |

### Recommendation:
- Conduct state-by-state analysis before launch
- Consider NMLS registration defensively
- Monitor for state regulator inquiries

---

## VIII. Potential Issues to Monitor

### A. If the App Adds Features

Adding these features could change the analysis:
- ❌ **Allowing transfers between users** → Likely money transmission
- ❌ **Letting users "cash out" to third parties** → Likely money transmission  
- ❌ **Holding balances across billing periods** → Stored value / prepaid access concerns
- ❌ **Pooling user money for payouts** → More like gambling/sweepstakes

### B. Gaming/Gambling Classification

If structured poorly, could be classified as:
- Illegal lottery (consideration + chance + prize)
- Online gambling

**Mitigation:** This app is skill-based (hitting fitness goals), not chance-based. The user controls outcomes through their behavior.

## IX. Regulatory Citations

### Federal:
- **31 CFR § 1010.100(ff)** — MSB Definition
- **31 CFR § 1010.100(ff)(5)** — Money Transmitter Definition
- **31 CFR § 1022.380** — MSB Registration Requirements
- **31 U.S.C. § 5330** — Registration of MSBs
- **FIN-2013-G001** — FinCEN Guidance on Virtual Currency (useful for "integral to services" analysis)

### Key FinCEN Guidance:
- FinCEN has consistently held that merchants who accept payment and then return value to the same customer are not engaging in money transmission
- The "integral to services" exemption protects businesses whose core product is not money movement

## X. Conclusion & Recommendation

### Final Assessment

| Regulatory Requirement | Likely Required? |
|------------------------|------------------|
| Federal MSB Registration (FinCEN) | **NO** |
| State Money Transmitter License | **Varies — analyze by state** |
| AML/KYC Program | Not for MSB reasons (may have other requirements) |
| SAR Filing | Not applicable |

### Recommended Next Steps:

1. ✅ **Proceed with current model** — Federal MSB registration likely not required
2. 📋 **Conduct state-by-state analysis** — Especially NY, CA, TX
3. 📝 **Document legal position** — Memorialize this analysis
4. ⚠️ **Monitor feature additions** — Re-analyze if adding P2P transfers or stored balances
5. 💬 **Consider defensive filing** — Some companies register defensively to avoid ambiguity
