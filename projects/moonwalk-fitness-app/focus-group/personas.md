# GROUP A: WOMEN (Various Ages)

## Persona 1: Maya, 25 - Urban Professional
**Location:** Austin, TX | **Income:** $75K | **Tech Savvy:** High

**Current Apps:** Nike Training Club (on and off), TikTok fitness videos, Spotify for workout playlists

**What Intimidates Her:**
> "I've tried so many apps and always fall off after 2 weeks. The guilt of seeing my streak broken makes me avoid the app entirely. Also, gyms feel judgmental—everyone seems to know what they're doing except me."

**What She Wishes Existed:**
> "An app that doesn't make me feel like a failure when I miss a day. Something that adapts to my chaotic schedule—some weeks I can do 5 workouts, some weeks none. And real community, not just leaderboards. I want to see women like me, not fitness influencers with perfect bodies."

**UX Preferences:** Modern, colorful, Instagram-worthy aesthetic. Video-first. Quick workouts (15-20 min).

**Price Sensitivity:** Will pay $10-15/month if she uses it. Has abandoned $25/month apps because guilt.

## Persona 2: Priya, 35 - Working Mom
**Location:** Chicago, IL | **Income:** $95K | **Tech Savvy:** Medium

**Current Apps:** MyFitnessPal (rarely), Peloton (husband's account), Apple Watch

**What Intimidates Her:**
> "Time is my enemy. I have maybe 20 minutes between putting kids to bed and collapsing myself. Most workout programs assume I have an hour. And the 'no excuses' culture makes me feel inadequate when I literally cannot make time."

**What She Wishes Existed:**
> "Something designed for moms. Not 'bouncing back after baby'—my youngest is 4. Just realistic workouts that work around chaos. I want to feel strong enough to carry my kids without hurting my back. Also, pelvic floor stuff no one talks about."

**UX Preferences:** Simple, fast loading, low cognitive load. Don't make her think. Offline mode for park trips.

**Price Sensitivity:** Will pay $15-20/month for something that actually fits her life. Values convenience highly.

## Persona 3: Danielle, 45 - Corporate Executive
**Location:** New York, NY | **Income:** $180K | **Tech Savvy:** Medium-High

**Current Apps:** Calm (for sleep), occasional Peloton, ClassPass for boutique studios

**What Intimidates Her:**
> "At 45, I'm noticing my body is different. Menopause symptoms are starting. The high-intensity stuff I did in my 30s destroys me now. Most apps assume you're 28 and can recover overnight."

**What She Wishes Existed:**
> "Something that understands perimenopause and menopause. Workouts that support hormonal health. I don't want to 'look hot'—I want to sleep better, reduce hot flashes, maintain bone density, and stay sharp mentally. The holistic approach."

**UX Preferences:** Premium feel, sophisticated, not childish. Clean design. Expert content.

**Price Sensitivity:** Money is not the barrier—value and results are. Will pay $50+/month for the right solution.

## Persona 4: Rosa, 55 - Empty Nester
**Location:** Phoenix, AZ | **Income:** $65K | **Tech Savvy:** Low-Medium

**Current Apps:** YouTube workout videos, basic step counter

**What Intimidates Her:**
> "Everything is designed for young people. The instructors are all 25, moving at 100 miles per hour. I can't keep up and feel embarrassed even though no one's watching. The technology part is also overwhelming—so many features."

**What She Wishes Existed:**
> "Slow, clear instruction. Someone my age showing me it's okay to modify. Focus on joint health—my knees aren't what they used to be. I'd love to see women who look like me. And maybe some social aspect to make friends? I'm lonely since the kids left."

**UX Preferences:** Large text, simple navigation, minimal features. Audio cues for exercises. Not too many choices.

**Price Sensitivity:** Budget-conscious but willing to pay $10-15/month for something that truly works for her.

## Persona 5: Patricia, 65 - Recently Retired
**Location:** Scottsdale, AZ | **Income:** $40K (fixed) | **Tech Savvy:** Low

**Current Apps:** None currently. Used SilverSneakers at gym pre-pandemic.

**What Intimidates Her:**
> "I don't understand these apps. My daughter downloaded one for me and I never opened it. Too many buttons. What if I hurt myself doing something wrong? I miss having a real teacher who can see if I'm doing it right."

**What She Wishes Existed:**
> "An app that feels like having a gentle friend guide you. Very simple. Maybe chair exercises for days when standing is hard. I'd love to connect with other women my age—not compete, just support. And something for my balance, I'm terrified of falling."

**UX Preferences:** Extra large text, voice guidance, minimal screens. iPad-friendly. Maybe a physical setup guide.

**Price Sensitivity:** Fixed income. Would pay $5-10/month max, but ideally free or through Medicare.

# GROUP B: SENIORS (Mixed Gender, 60-80)

## Persona 6: Harold, 68 - Retired Engineer
**Location:** Denver, CO | **Income:** $55K (retirement) | **Tech Savvy:** Medium

**Current Apps:** Garmin Connect (for golf), weather apps

**What Intimidates Him:**
> "I'm not interested in getting ripped. I just want to stay mobile enough to play with my grandkids and golf with my buddies. These apps all seem designed to make you an athlete. I just want to not fall apart."

**What He Wishes Existed:**
> "Something focused on functional fitness. Can I get off the floor if I fall? Can I carry groceries? Flexibility for my golf swing. Nothing with loud music or aggressive trainers. Maybe something my wife and I could do together."

**UX Preferences:** Clean, professional, not flashy. Good audio since his vision isn't great. Printable routines.

**Price Sensitivity:** Has disposable income, will pay $15-20/month for quality. Values not wasting time on junk.

## Persona 7: Eleanor, 72 - Former Teacher
**Location:** Minneapolis, MN | **Income:** $35K (Social Security + pension) | **Tech Savvy:** Low

**Current Apps:** FaceTime (to talk to grandkids), some games

**What Intimidates Her:**
> "Everything moves too fast. I can't follow along when they're demonstrating and talking at the same time. And the young people in workout clothes make me feel like I don't belong."

**What She Wishes Existed:**
> "Step-by-step video where they actually wait for you. Exercises I can do in my apartment without any equipment. Something for my osteoporosis—my doctor says I need weight-bearing exercise but I don't know what that means. A 'friend' mode where I could exercise with my sister across the country."

**UX Preferences:** Very simple. Big buttons. Friendly voice. Maybe phone support for questions.

**Price Sensitivity:** Very budget-conscious. $5-8/month maximum. Would love free through Medicare.

---

## Persona 8: William, 75 - Retired Military
**Location:** San Antonio, TX | **Income:** $50K (military pension) | **Tech Savvy:** Medium

**Current Apps:** VA health apps, basic fitness tracker

**What Intimidates Him:**
> "I used to be in great shape. Now I have two bad knees and a replaced hip. I can't do what these apps show. I need modifications for old injuries, not just 'beginner' versions."

**What He Wishes Existed:**
> "Programs designed around limitations, not despite them. I have specific physical restrictions—let me input them and get a custom program. Also, something that tracks health metrics that matter to seniors: blood pressure correlation, heart rate during exercise, medication reminders."

**UX Preferences:** Military-like precision in the interface. Clear metrics. Progress tracking.

**Price Sensitivity:** Will pay $15-25/month for a serious, effective program. Doesn't want gimmicks.

---

## Persona 9: Betty, 78 - Widowed, Lives with Daughter
**Location:** Philadelphia, PA | **Income:** $25K (Social Security) | **Tech Savvy:** Very Low

**Current Apps:** Whatever her daughter sets up for her

**What Intimidates Her:**
> "I don't know how to use apps. I'm afraid I'll break something or subscribe to something expensive accidentally. After my husband passed, I've become more sedentary. I know I need to move but I don't know where to start."

**What She Wishes Existed:**
> "Something so simple my daughter could set it up once and I just press play. Chair exercises because standing too long is hard. Maybe someone to check on me—not in a creepy way, but to notice if I haven't moved in days. Reminders to take walks."

**UX Preferences:** Absolutely minimal. One big button. Voice control ideal. Maybe a dedicated device, not a phone.

**Price Sensitivity:** Daughter would pay, probably $10-15/month if it keeps mom healthy and safe.

---

## Persona 10: Frank, 80 - Active Senior
**Location:** Florida | **Income:** $60K (investments + SS) | **Tech Savvy:** Medium

**Current Apps:** SilverSneakers GO, basic health trackers

**What Intimidates Him:**
> "Nothing really intimidates me anymore at 80. But I am annoyed that most 'senior' apps treat us like we're fragile. I swim every day, walk 3 miles. I want to maintain this, not just survive."

**What He Wishes Existed:**
> "An app that respects that some seniors are actually fit. Progressive difficulty. Maybe a way to connect with other active seniors—not everyone my age is decrepit. Social features that don't feel like a nursing home activity board."

**UX Preferences:** Respects his capability. Doesn't condescend. Clear metrics and progress.

**Price Sensitivity:** Will pay premium ($20-30/month) for premium service. Time is more valuable than money at 80.

---

# GROUP C: SENIOR WOMEN (60-80)

## Persona 11: Margaret, 62 - Still Working Part-Time
**Location:** Portland, OR | **Income:** $45K | **Tech Savvy:** Medium

**Current Apps:** Fitbit, some YouTube yoga

**What Intimidates Her:**
> "I'm in this weird middle zone—too young for 'senior' apps that feel geriatric, but too old for apps where everyone looks 30. I've been active my whole life but things are changing. Menopause was brutal. Now it's arthritis."

**What She Wishes Existed:**
> "An app for women in transition—60s and beyond but not elderly. Yoga that addresses my specific aches. Something that acknowledges wisdom and experience, not just youth. A community of women like me who've raised families, had careers, and want this chapter to be healthy."

**UX Preferences:** Modern but not trendy. Calming colors. Good video quality. Journaling/reflection features.

**Price Sensitivity:** $15-20/month for the right fit. Has been paying for ClassPass but rarely uses it.

## Persona 12: Diane, 67 - Breast Cancer Survivor
**Location:** Atlanta, GA | **Income:** $38K | **Tech Savvy:** Low-Medium

**Current Apps:** Cancer support apps, step counter

**What Intimidates Her:**
> "After treatment, I'm rebuilding strength but I'm terrified of overdoing it. Most fitness apps don't understand recovery from illness. And the lymphedema from my mastectomy means I have to be careful with certain arm movements."

**What She Wishes Existed:**
> "Fitness for survivors. Gentle rebuilding. Understanding of medical limitations. Connection with other women who've been through similar experiences. Mental health integration because cancer doesn't just affect the body."

**UX Preferences:** Soft, healing aesthetic. Calm instructors. Medical-professional-level accuracy.

**Price Sensitivity:** Budget matters, but health is #1 priority. Would pay $15/month if it understood her needs.

---

## Persona 13: Yuki, 70 - Japanese-American, Health Focused
**Location:** Seattle, WA | **Income:** $42K | **Tech Savvy:** Medium

**Current Apps:** MyFitnessPal, meditation app

**What Intimidates Her:**
> "American fitness culture is so aggressive. All the apps want you to 'crush' your goals, 'destroy' your workout. In Japanese culture, we have gentler approaches—balance, harmony. I want gentle progress, not war."

**What She Wishes Existed:**
> "An app influenced by Eastern philosophy. Tai chi, gentle yoga, mindfulness movement. Focus on longevity and vitality, not weight loss. Respect for the body's limits. Maybe integration with traditional practices. Certainly a community that values peace over competition."

**UX Preferences:** Serene design. Natural imagery. Japanese aesthetic influence (wabi-sabi). Slow, mindful UX.

**Price Sensitivity:** Willing to pay $15-20/month for aligned values and quality content.

## Persona 14: Gloria, 73 - Grandmother of 7
**Location:** Houston, TX | **Income:** $32K | **Tech Savvy:** Low

**Current Apps:** Facebook, basic messaging

**What Intimidates Her:**
> "I don't want to look foolish. At my age, trying new things feels risky—what if I fall? What if I can't keep up? My grandkids would laugh if they saw me trying to exercise."

**What She Wishes Existed:**
> "Something private where no one judges me. Something I can do in my living room with clear instruction. Maybe even something to do WITH my grandkids—like a family mode where we exercise together over video. I want to be healthy enough to be there for them."

**UX Preferences:** Very simple. Private. No social sharing unless she wants. Large text. Slow pace.

**Price Sensitivity:** Living on Social Security. Free through Medicare ideal. Max $10/month.

---

## Persona 15: Carol, 77 - Former Dancer
**Location:** Santa Fe, NM | **Income:** $28K | **Tech Savvy:** Low

**Current Apps:** None really. Prefers DVDs she's had for years.

**What Intimidates Her:**
> "I was a professional dancer until my 40s. My body remembers movement beautifully, but it can't do what it once did. These apps have no understanding of someone who was once elite. They either assume you're broken or assume you're starting from zero."

**What She Wishes Existed:**
> "Movement programs that honor the body's history. Dance-based fitness that doesn't require jumping or impact. Ways to maintain grace and fluidity. Connection with other former athletes/dancers who understand the bittersweet relationship with aging bodies."

**UX Preferences:** Elegant, artistic design. Beautiful movement videos. Classical or jazz music options.

**Price Sensitivity:** Limited income but would prioritize spending on this. $15/month acceptable.
