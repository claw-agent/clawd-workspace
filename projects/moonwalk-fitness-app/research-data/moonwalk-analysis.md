- Crypto-native users (small demographic)
- Competitive, risk-tolerant individuals

- Not motivating for non-competitive personalities

### 4. **Limited Fitness Scope**

  - Nutrition
  - Sleep
  - Holistic health

### 5. **Regulatory Risk**

## What Moonwalk Does Well (To Carry Forward)

1. **Accountability through stakes** - Real consequences motivate action
2. **Social dynamics** - Friends and community matter
3. **Gamification** - Making fitness feel like a game works
4. **Clear metrics** - Steps are measurable and objective
5. **Mobile-first** - Modern UX expectations

## Gap for New App

The second app should:
- Remove crypto requirement entirely
- Target women and seniors specifically
- Focus on positive reinforcement, not financial loss
- Expand beyond steps to holistic wellness
- Create sustainable habits, not just challenges
- Make fitness feel approachable, not intimidating
