# Moonwalk Fitness: Second App Strategy
## Comprehensive Market Research Report

**Prepared for:** Moonwalk Fitness Leadership
**Date:** January 2026
**Research Scope:** Women's Fitness & Senior Wellness App Markets

---

# Executive Summary

Moonwalk Fitness has built a successful crypto-native competitive fitness app. However, this model inherently limits addressable market due to:
- Crypto payment rails excluding 90%+ of potential users
- Competitive/financial mechanics alienating women and seniors
- Male-skewing, risk-tolerant audience focus

This research explores opportunity for a **second app** targeting underserved high-value segments: **women** and **seniors**.

## Key Findings

1. **Market Size:** Global fitness app market is $12.12B (2025), growing to $33.58B by 2033
2. **Underserved Segments:** Women seeking empowerment (not competition) and seniors seeking independence (not athleticism)
3. **Successful Models:** Sweat (women, $400M acquisition), SilverSneakers (seniors, 15M+ members via insurance)
4. **Market Gaps:** Menopause-focused wellness, gentle movement apps, community-without-competition
5. **Recommended Concept:** "Bloom" - Life-stage fitness for women

**Gap:** 50M+ American women in menopause; almost no dedicated apps
