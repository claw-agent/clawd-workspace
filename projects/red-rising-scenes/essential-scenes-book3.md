## Scene 1: "Only the Dark"
**Chapter:** 1 (Only the Dark) | **Why Essential:** Darrow has been in solitary confinement for nine months inside a dining table. The darkness has nearly broken him. This is rock bottom — the lowest a hero can fall.

**Key Characters:** Darrow (alone in darkness)

**The Passage:**
> Deep in darkness, far from warmth and sun and moons, I lie, quiet as the stone that surrounds me, imprisoning my hunched body in a dreadful womb. I cannot stand. Cannot stretch. I can only curl in a ball, a withered fossil of the man that was. Hands cuffed behind my back. Naked on cold rock.

> Am I asleep? Am I awake? I've lost my way. Everything bleeding together, drowning me in visions and whispers and sounds. Again and again I jerk Eo's fragile little ankles. Break Julian's face. Hear Pax and Quinn and Tactus and Lorn and Victra sigh their last. So much pain. And for what?

> "It's only the dark," I whisper. Only the dark playing tricks on my mind.

> If this is the end, I will rage toward it. But as I pull back my head to deliver one last great blow, existence groans. Rumbling like an earthquake. Not the darkness. Something beyond. Something in the stone itself, growing louder and deeper above me, till the darkness cracks and a blazing sword of light slashes down.

**Visual Notes:** Total black. Only the sound of breathing and a heartbeat. Then fragments — whispered voices, hallucinated faces. Darrow slamming his head against stone. Blood in the dark. Then: light splitting the darkness like a wound.

**Narration Excerpt:** "I cannot stand. Cannot stretch. I can only curl in a ball, a withered fossil of the man that was."

## Scene 2: "Prisoner L17L6363 — The Table"
**Chapter:** 2 (Prisoner L17L6363) | **Why Essential:** The horrific reveal — Darrow's prison was a dining table. The Jackal and his allies have eaten above him every night. The cruelty is mundane.

**Key Characters:** Darrow, The Jackal, Cassius, Aja au Grimmus, Antonia

**The Passage:**
> I lie upon stone. It stretches around me to either side. Black, rippling with blue and purple, like the shell of a Creonian beetle. A floor? No. I see cups. Saucers. A cart of coffee. It's a table. That was my prison. Not some hideous abyss. Just a meter-wide, twelve-meter-long slab of marble with a hollow center. They've eaten inches above me every night.

> I look up from the coffee tray by my head. Someone stares at me... "My honored guests. May I present prisoner L17L6363."

> I am a corpse. Skeletal and pallid. Ribs erupt from skin thinner than the film atop heated milk. Knees jut from spindly legs... Muscle has withered. And tubes that kept me alive in the darkness erupt from my belly, black and stringy umbilical cords still anchoring me to the floor of my cell.

> Cassius strips off his white cloak and drapes it over my shivering body. For a moment, no one speaks, as struck by the act as I. "Thank you," I croak. But he looks away from my hollow face. Pity is not forgiveness, nor is gratitude absolution.

**Visual Notes:** Bright room. Coffee cups, civilized conversation. Then the table opens and a skeletal, filthy creature is revealed — barely human. Gold dignitaries recoiling. Cassius draping his white cloak over the wreck. The juxtaposition of refined evil and raw suffering.

**Narration Excerpt:** "Pity is not forgiveness, nor is gratitude absolution."

## Scene 3: "Snakebite — The Rescue Begins"
**Chapter:** 3 (Snakebite) | **Why Essential:** Holiday and Trigg — Gray siblings — rescue Darrow. The moment the rebellion proves it transcends Color. Sevro's voice on the comm bringing Darrow back from the edge.

**Key Characters:** Darrow, Holiday ti Nakamura, Trigg ti Nakamura, Sevro (hologram)

**The Passage:**
> "Name's Holiday ti Nakamura. That's Trigg, my baby brother." She raises a scar-notched eyebrow. "Question is, who are you?"

> "Who am I?" I mumble.

> "We came for the Reaper. But if that's you, I think we should get our money back."

> Holiday strips her datapad and tosses it to me... a hologram of a spiked sunburst helmet suddenly blossoms into the air. Red eyes glow out balefully from the helmet.

> "Sevro?" I almost whimper the word.

> "Oy, boyo, you look like you slithered out of a skeleton's rickety cooch." He cackles. "Now it's time you come home, Reap. But I can't come to you. You gotta come to me. You register?"

> "Look past our Color," Holiday says to me... Eo's words sound so different from her mouth. Yet I think it's the moment my soul comes back to me.

**Visual Notes:** Processing room. Bodies of executed guards. Two Grays offering Darrow his razor — etched with images of Eo, his family, his childhood. Sevro's holographic face, grinning. Darrow weeping as he holds the blade. Then Holiday's hand reaching down.

**Narration Excerpt:** "Look past our Color. Eo's words sound so different from her mouth. Yet I think it's the moment my soul comes back to me."

---

## Scene 4: "The Bridge — Trigg's Death"
**Chapter:** 5 (Plan C) | **Why Essential:** The cost of rescue. Aja kills Trigg on a landing pad as Darrow watches helplessly. Holiday loses her brother. War extracts its price.

**Key Characters:** Darrow, Holiday, Trigg, Aja au Grimmus, Cassius, Victra (unconscious)

**The Passage:**
> "Love you, kiddo," Holiday says.

> "Love you too, babydoll," Trigg murmurs back, voice tight and mechanical now.

> Too late. Behind him, Aja au Grimmus rips out of the fortress's door, past the Grays, past the Obsidians... She's in her black formal jacket. Her long legs reel Trigg in now. It's one of the saddest sights I've ever seen.

> I fire my pistol. Holiday unloads her rifle. We hit nothing but air. Aja sidesteps, twists, and, when Trigg is ten paces from us, spears him through the torso with her razor... "Trigg..." Holiday whispers.

> "Come out," Aja says. And she tosses Trigg off her blade over the side of the bridge. He falls two hundred meters before his body splits against a granite ledge below.

**Visual Notes:** Snow-covered landing pad. Wind howling. Trigg sprinting toward safety. Aja — impossibly fast, elegant — running him down. The spear through his body. Holiday's face. The body tossed off the bridge. Falling. Falling.

**Narration Excerpt:** "'Love you, kiddo,' Holiday says. 'Love you too, babydoll,' Trigg murmurs back."

## Scene 5: "The Leap — clawDrill Rescue"
**Chapter:** 5-6 (Plan C) | **Why Essential:** Darrow leaps off a mountain with Holiday and Victra — a suicidal plunge — only to be caught by Sevro and the Howlers erupting from a clawDrill tunnel. The rebellion rises from the earth itself.

**Key Characters:** Darrow, Holiday, Victra, Cassius, Aja, Sevro, Ragnar, the Howlers

**The Passage:**
> "Listen to the wind, Cassius. Listen to the bloodydamn wind." The two knights tilt their heads. And still they do not understand the strange groaning sound that drifts up from the valley floor, because how would a son and daughter of Gold ever know the sound of a clawDrill gnawing through rock?

> "Goodbye, Cassius," I say. "Expect me." And I push off the ledge with both legs, flinging myself backward into open air, dragging Holiday and Victra into thin air.

> Then the air cracks with a sonic boom... as a whole chorus resounds out from the darkness of the clawDrill-carved tunnel as it gives birth to a small army. Amidst the rising Sons of Ares, a crimson, armored man with the spiked helmet of his father zips forward and catches Victra... It is Ragnar Volarus, prince of the Valkyrie Spires. He tosses Holiday to another Howler and pushes me behind him so I can wrap my arms around his neck... "Hold fast, little brother."

**Visual Notes:** Darrow on the edge, skeletal, defiant, holding two unconscious women. Cassius and Aja watching. He falls backward. Then: the earth explodes below — a clawDrill erupting, molten fingers grasping at the sky. Red-armored figures screaming upward. Sevro catching Victra. Ragnar catching Darrow. Diving into darkness together.

**Narration Excerpt:** "How would a son and daughter of Gold ever know the sound of a clawDrill gnawing through rock?"

## Scene 6: "Mother"
**Chapter:** 7 (The Afterbirth) | **Why Essential:** Darrow wakes in Tinos to find his family alive. His mother at his bedside. The most quietly devastating reunion in the series.

**Key Characters:** Darrow, his mother, Uncle Narol, Dancer

**The Passage:**
> My eyes open. I'm in a bed. White sheets, IVs going into my arms... Beside him sits my mother. A bent, fragile woman since her stroke... Her broken body is not what she is on the inside. There she stands tall as any Gold, broad as any Obsidian.

> "Hello, child."

> She stands above me, overwhelming me with the love in her eyes. My hand is almost larger than her head, but I gently touch her face as if to prove to myself she is real. I trace the crow's-feet from her eyes to the gray hair at her temples.

> "I'm sorry...," I find myself saying. "I'm so sorry..."

> She kisses my forehead and rocks her head against mine. She smells like rust and sweat and oil. Like home.

> "I gave up on you," she says softly, voice cracking. "I gave up." ... "Sevro did," she says. "He never stopped looking for you."

**Visual Notes:** Cave hospital. White sheets, IVs. A weathered old Red woman sitting beside a ruined giant. Her hand on his. The size difference — his hand covers her whole head, yet she is the strong one. Tears. The smell of home.

**Narration Excerpt:** "She smells like rust and sweat and oil. Like home. Mother is the spine in me. The iron."

---

## Scene 7: "Pulling Teeth"
**Chapter:** ~20-22 | **Why Essential:** The Howlers pull their back teeth — removing the poison capsule every Son carries. Ragnar goes first, ripping his out with bare fingers. It's disgusting, funny, and deeply bonding. They choose to believe they might actually live.

**Key Characters:** Darrow, Sevro, Ragnar, the Howlers, Quicksilver

**The Passage:**
> Ragnar does not wait for the pliers. He pulls out his back tooth with his bare fingers, eyes wide with delight as he sets the huge bloody thing on the table. "I die with my friends." One by one, they pass around the pliers, pulling out their teeth and tossing them down. Quicksilver watches all the while, staring at us like we're a pack of mad hooligans, no doubt wondering about what he's gotten himself into.

**Visual Notes:** War room. Hardened soldiers passing pliers around a table, yanking teeth, bleeding, laughing. Ragnar grinning with blood on his lips. Quicksilver — the richest man alive — watching in horrified fascination. Camaraderie forged in blood and absurdity.

**Narration Excerpt:** "I die with my friends."

---

## Scene 8: "The Speech — I Would Have Lived in Peace"
**Chapter:** ~25 (Praetors) | **Why Essential:** Darrow addresses the Colors of the Rising for the first time as himself — not a Gold mask, but a Red who carved his way up. The dream spoken aloud.

**Key Characters:** Darrow

**The Passage:**
> "I would have lived in peace. But my enemies brought me war. My name is Darrow of Lykos. You know my story. It is but an echo of your own. They came to my home and killed my wife, not for singing a song but for daring to question their reign. For daring to have a voice. For centuries millions beneath the soil of Mars have been fed lies from cradle to grave. That lie has been revealed to them. Now they've entered the world you know, and they suffer as you do."

**Visual Notes:** Cargo bay or hangar. Thousands of faces — Red, Gray, Orange, Obsidian, Blue — looking up at a scarred, battered man who looks nothing like the golden legend. His voice carrying the weight of every life lost. The crowd silent. Then: a roar.

**Narration Excerpt:** "I would have lived in peace. But my enemies brought me war."

---

## Scene 9: "Ragnar's Death"
**Chapter:** ~34-35 | **Why Essential:** The most devastating death in the trilogy. Aja kills Ragnar on the ice of his homeland, within sight of the Valkyrie Spires. He dies in Darrow's arms as his sister Sefi arrives on griffinback.

**Key Characters:** Darrow, Ragnar, Aja, Mustang, Sefi the Quiet, the Valkyrie

**The Passage:**
> Ragnar swings down at Aja with a blacksmith's overhead strike, Aja raises her rigid blade to meet his. She activates the whip function. Her blade goes limp... She's already spinning to the side, contracting the whip back into a blade and using her momentum to hack sideways at Ragnar... The movement is simple. Laconic. Like one of the ballerinas... pivoting through a fouetté.

> Aja does not miss.

> "I always dreamed of a good death." He shudders as he realizes again that he's dying. "This does not seem good."

> "I carried you on my shoulders to watch five Breakings... I am your brother. And when the men of the Weeping Sun took me... do you remember what I told you?" Sefi extends a hand... He seizes her hand and presses it fiercely to his chest so she can feel his fading heartbeat. "I told you I would return."

> "No, Sefi," he says, dropping the axe and taking snow in his left hand, her hand with his right. "Live for more." He nods to me.

> The wind whips. The snow falls. Ragnar watches the sky, where the cold lights of Phobos glitter on as I silently slide the metal into his heart.

**Visual Notes:** Arctic ice field. Two titans fighting — Aja's elegant spin, Ragnar's blood arcing across white snow. Then stillness. Sefi arriving on a griffin — three thousand kilograms of winged predator piercing clouds. The sister kneeling over her brother. Snow gathering on his white beard as he watches the sky. Darrow's blade sliding in. Silence.

**Narration Excerpt:** "'Live for more.' He nods to me. The wind whips. The snow falls."

## Scene 10: "Omnis Vir Lupus — The Howl"
**Chapter:** ~42-43 | **Why Essential:** Pinned down by crushing artificial gravity, the Howlers howl. Pretending to be brave until they become brave. The essence of the rebellion in one primal moment.

**Key Characters:** Darrow, Sevro, Ragnar, Pebble, Clown, Victra

**The Passage:**
> Security has increased the artificial gravity in the room, and only Ragnar's not on his belly. He's fallen to a knee, shoulders hunched and straining, like Atlas holding up the world.

> "Omnis vir lupus!" I shout, kicking my head back to howl, exhaling all the air in my lungs. Beside me, Ragnar's eyes widen in wild ecstasy. He opens his massive mouth and bellows out a howl to make his ancestors hear him from their icy crypts. Then Pebble joins, and Clown, and even regal Victra.

> It's rage and fear leaving our bodies. Though space drags us across the floor to its embrace. Though death might come for us. I am home in this weird screaming mass of humanity. And as we pretend to be brave, we become so.

**Visual Notes:** Bodies pressed to the floor by invisible force. Faces straining. Then Darrow throws his head back and howls — a sound that has no right coming from a crushed man. One by one, voices join. The howl echoing through metal corridors.

**Narration Excerpt:** "As we pretend to be brave, we become so."

---

## Scene 11: "The Jackal's Gambit — Nuclear Fire"
**Chapter:** ~61 (The Red) | **Why Essential:** The Jackal's final play — nuclear bombs detonating across Luna, millions dying, as he demands Darrow's suicide. The ultimate test of what Darrow has become.

**Key Characters:** Darrow, The Jackal, Mustang, Sevro, Cassius, Lysander

**The Passage:**
> "Kill yourself. Here. In front of my sister. In return, three billion souls live. Isn't that what you've always wanted? To be a hero? You die, and I will be crowned Sovereign. There will be peace."

> My friends have breathed love into me, breathed my faith back into my bones. They've made me want to live. They've made me want to build. Mustang looks at me, her eyes glassy, and I know she wants me to choose life, but she will not choose for me.

> "No." I punch him in the throat... I jam my hand into his mouth... "This is always how the story would end, Adrius. Not with your screams. Not with your rage. But with your silence." And with a great pull, I rip out the tongue of the Jackal.

**Visual Notes:** Command room. Holographic moon above — red blossoms of nuclear fire blooming across its surface. The Jackal smiling. Mustang's eyes. Then Darrow's choice — not death, not surrender. Violence. His helldiver hand reaching into the Jackal's mouth. The silence after.

**Narration Excerpt:** "This is always how the story would end, Adrius. Not with your screams. Not with your rage. But with your silence."

---

## Scene 12: "Hail, Sovereign"
**Chapter:** 63 (Silence) / 64 (Hail) | **Why Essential:** Mustang takes the Senate with scepter and severed head, claiming the Sovereignty. Darrow kneels — not in subjugation but in love. The revolution wins not with a sword but with a bridge.

**Key Characters:** Mustang, Darrow, Cassius, Sevro, Lysander, the Senate

**The Passage:**
> Mustang takes the podium... "Senators of the Society, I stand before you, Virginia au Augustus. Daughter of Nero au Augustus of the Lion House of Mars... Sixty years ago Octavia au Lune stood before you with the head of a tyrant, her father, and laid her claim on the post of Sovereign to this Society. I stand before you now with the head of a tyrant." She lifts her left hand to show the head of Octavia.

> "Bend. Or break."

> I fall to my knee before Mustang. Looking up into her eyes, I put my stump over my heart... "Hail, Sovereign," I say. Then Cassius falls to his knee. And Sevro. Then Lysander au Lune and the Praetorians, and then one by one the Senators fall to their knees till all but fifty kneel and break the silence together, shouting with a single riotous voice: "Hail, Sovereign. Hail, Sovereign!"

**Visual Notes:** Vast white marble Senate chamber. Tiered seats rising like a funnel. A bloody, battered woman at the podium holding a scepter in one hand and a severed head in the other. Behind her: Darrow (missing a hand), Cassius, Sevro (who definitely soiled himself). One by one, hundreds kneel. The sound building from silence to a roar.

**Narration Excerpt:** "Bend. Or break."

---

## Scene 13: "The Jackal Hangs"
**Chapter:** 64-65 | **Why Essential:** The Jackal hangs. Mustang pulls her brother's feet — echoing Darrow pulling Eo's in Book 1. The circle closes.

**Key Characters:** Mustang, The Jackal, Darrow

**The Passage:**
> Under the supervision of Holiday, Sefi has set off to Mars... A week after Mustang's ascension, I stand beside her to watch her brother hang... He stands proud and vain as they loop the noose around his neck.

> On Mars there's not much gravity, so you have to pull the feet to break the neck. They let the loved ones do it. On Luna there's even less. But no one comes forward from the crowd as the White extends the invitation...

> So I lightly squeeze her hand and guide her forward. She moves across the snow in a daze to grip her twin brother's feet. Looking up at him as if this were a dream. She whispers something and, lowering her head, she pulls down, showing him he was loved, even at the end.

**Visual Notes:** Luna square. Light snow falling. The Jackal on the scaffold — hair feathery, lime green jumpsuit, standing proud. The noose. Silence. No one comes forward. Then Mustang, guided by Darrow's hand, walking to her twin brother's feet. She pulls. The most intimate violence in the series.

**Narration Excerpt:** "On Mars there's not much gravity, so you have to pull the feet to break the neck. They let the loved ones do it."

---

## Scene 14: "The Beach — Pax"
**Chapter:** 65 (The Vale) / Epilogue | **Why Essential:** The ending. Earth. A beach. Mustang reveals their son — named Pax. Darrow's family arrives. After everything, he can be a father.

**Key Characters:** Darrow, Mustang, Pax (their son), Darrow's mother, Kieran, Sevro, Victra, Kavax, Dancer

**The Passage:**
> "Eo would have loved it here, wouldn't she?" Mustang asks me. She wears a black coat with the collar pulled up around her neck.

> "Yes," I say. "She would have."

> "There's something I have to tell you... I didn't want to lie to you. But I didn't know how you would react."

> The ramp unfurls. Sophocles sprints out onto the beach, running toward a group of seagulls. Behind him comes the voice of Kavax and the sweet sound of a child laughing. My feet falter. I look over at Mustang in confusion. She pulls me on, a nervous smile on her face... My mother joins them now on the ramp, walking with Kieran to set foot on Earth for the first time. She smiles like I did when she smells the salt... And in her arms she carries a laughing child with golden hair.

> "Mustang?" I ask. My voice trembling. "Who is that?"

> "Darrow..." Mustang smiles over at me. "That is our son. His name is Pax."

**Visual Notes:** Pacific Northwest coast. Sea stacks, evergreens, mist. A driftwood fire. Two people on a beach. Then a ship descending. A dog sprinting. Friends emerging. An old Red woman stepping onto Earth for the first time, smelling salt air, wind in her gray hair. In her arms: a laughing golden-haired child. Darrow's face — breaking open.

**Narration Excerpt:** "That is our son. His name is Pax."
