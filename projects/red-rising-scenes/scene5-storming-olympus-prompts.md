## Shot 1: The Assault — Wide (8-10s)
**Prompt:** An army of young warriors in crude armor storms up a snowy mountainside toward a fortress at the peak. Explosions light the slopes. Banners flutter. The mountain is wreathed in clouds and morning light. Epic scale — hundreds of figures climbing through snow and fire. Mars landscape visible in the distant horizon. Shot on 35mm film, extreme wide, golden dawn light breaking through storm clouds.

**Camera:** Sweeping wide establishing shot. The mountain fortress above, the army below. Scale and chaos. This is the climax — everything converging on Olympus.

## Shot 2: The Razor Duel — Interior (10-12s)
**Prompt:** Two armored warriors fight with whip-swords inside a high-tech command room. One is tall with golden eyes in battered salvaged armor, fighting with raw aggression — screaming, hacking with two weapons. The other is in pristine golden armor, taller, more skilled, coldly efficient. Sparks fly as blades clash. The whip-swords shift between rigid blade and flexible lash. Holographic displays shatter around them. Shot on 35mm film, dynamic handheld, amber sparks, close-quarters violence.

**Camera:** Frenetic handheld tracking the duel. Darrow is outmatched but refuses to stop — screaming, swinging wildly with slingBlade and razor both. Jupiter is surgical, precise, dangerous.

## Shot 3: Through the Window (5-8s)
**Prompt:** Two armored warriors crash through a massive window and fall into open air. Glass shards explode outward in slow motion. A snow-covered mountainside below them. Neither has flight capability — they are simply falling. One in battered dark armor, one in pristine gold. The mountain drops away beneath them. Shot on 35mm film, slow motion, wide angle, vertigo-inducing.

**Camera:** From inside looking out as they crash through. Then exterior — two figures tumbling through the air, mountain and sky spinning. Slow-motion glass catching the light.

---

## Shot 4: The Snowbank Impact (3-5s)
**Prompt:** Two armored warriors crash into a deep snowbank on a steep mountainside. Snow explodes upward. They roll and slide toward a cliff edge. One catches himself, clawing at the snow. The other rises first. Cold white morning light. Shot on 35mm film, wide, high-speed capture of the impact.

**Camera:** Wide shot of the mountainside. The impact. Snow settling. Two dark figures emerging from white.

---

## Shot 5: Standoff in the Clouds (8-10s)
**Prompt:** Two warriors face each other on a snow-covered mountainside above the clouds. One in pristine golden armor — tall, lean, violent, blood dripping from gold. Behind him, clouds and the curve of a red planet's horizon. The other in battered dark armor, wounded, exhausted but standing. Morning breaking behind them. Epic, mythological. Shot on 35mm film, wide anamorphic, golden dawn light, breath visible in cold.

**Camera:** Wide two-shot with the Martian dawn behind them. Jupiter: a god of war in gold. Darrow: beaten but unbroken. The mountain, the clouds, the red planet — mythological scale.

---

## Shot 6: "Go Ahead, Sevro" (8-10s)
**Prompt:** A battered warrior in dark armor drops his weapons in the snow. He smiles. The golden-armored warrior opposite him hesitates, confused. Then — from the snow itself — an invisible force strikes the golden warrior's legs from behind. He collapses, slashing wildly at empty air. His strike goes too high — he's used to fighting men his height, not something small and invisible. Snow swirls where the unseen attacker moves. Shot on 35mm film, medium-wide, the moment of the cheat.

**Camera:** On Darrow's face — the smile. "So I'll cheat." Cut to Jupiter's legs buckling. The invisible attack from the snow. Jupiter's confused rage as he falls.

**Content note:** Sevro in a ghostCloak is literally invisible. Show his presence through snow displacement, footprints appearing, and Jupiter's legs giving out — NOT a visible figure.

---

## Shot 7: Olympus Fallen — Final Wide (8-10s)
**Prompt:** Wide shot of a snow-covered mountain peak at dawn. Two figures at the summit — one standing, one fallen. A red cloth headband tied around the golden armor of the fallen warrior. Below, an army cheering on the slopes. The fortress behind them captured, banners changed. Mars's red horizon glowing. The mountain taken. Shot on 35mm film, extreme wide, epic, golden light, triumphant.

**Camera:** Slow pull-back from the two figures to reveal the entire mountain. The army. The dawn. The red planet. Olympus has fallen. Hold on the wide shot as morning fully breaks.

## Production Notes

### Narration Script (Claw Voice)
> "Only my weapons can hurt him. They aren't enough."
>
> "I scream and hack in swirling arcs with my slingBlade, even as I stab clumsily with my razor. It's a mad dance."
>
> "We smash into a holoImmersion room. Sparks fly. I keep screaming and pushing... until I take him through a window, and we spill out into the open air."
>
> "Neither of us have gravBoots. So we plummet a hundred feet into a snowbank on the mountain's side."
>
> [pause]
>
> "The clouds clear, and Jupiter stands before me in the white. Red drips from his golden armor. He is tall. Lean. Violent."
>
> [pause]
>
> "'So I'll cheat.'"
>
> "I nod. 'Go ahead, Sevro.'"
>
> "The razor slithers up from the ground, stiffens, and goes through Jupiter's hamstrings as he wheels about. His slash goes two feet too high."
>
> "He's used to fighting men."

### Kling 3.0 Settings
- **Mode:** Multi-Shot (Darrow + Jupiter consistent through combat)
- **Element Reference:** Darrow Gold (armored), Jupiter ref needed (tall, golden armor, lean predator)
- **Aspect:** 16:9 cinematic
- **Duration:** 5-12s per shot
- **Negative prompt:** modern clothing, indoor lighting, flat terrain, cartoon, anime

### Color Palette
- Shots 1-3: Interior amber/spark orange → exterior white
- Shots 4-5: White snow, golden dawn, red planet horizon
- Shot 6: Cool blue-white snow, golden armor as the only warm tone
- Shot 7: Full golden dawn — triumphant, warm, epic

### Key Visual Motifs
- **David vs. Goliath** — Darrow outmatched in skill and equipment, winning through will + Sevro
- **The cheat** — the entire series philosophy: Gold expects fair combat, Darrow fights to WIN
- **Mythological scale** — literally storming Olympus, fighting a Proctor named Jupiter
- **Dawn = victory** — morning breaking as Olympus falls
- **The invisible friend** — Sevro as the unseen ace, the wolf in the snow

### Character Notes (Need Refs)
- **Jupiter (Proctor):** Tall, lean, golden armor (pristine, military-grade — NOT student gear). Professional killer. A god playing with mortals.
- **Darrow (armored):** Battered salvaged armor, slingBlade + razor (whip-sword). Fighting above his weight class through sheer fury.
- **Sevro:** Invisible in ghostCloak. Present only as displaced snow and the fallen Jupiter. Small — which is why Jupiter's counter-slash goes "two feet too high."
