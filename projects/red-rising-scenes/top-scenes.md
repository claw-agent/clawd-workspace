## 1. EO'S SONG AND HANGING
**Chapter:** ~8-9 ("The Laurel" / early Part I) | **Lines:** ~1174-1290

### Why It's Visually Striking
This is THE scene that defines the entire series. A young woman, whipped bloody, choosing to sing a forbidden song of rebellion in front of an indifferent god-king — knowing it means death. The contrast between Eo's fragile beauty and raw defiance against Augustus's cold golden perfection is devastating. This is the scene fans will riot over if Hollywood sanitizes it.

### Key Characters
Darrow (bound, watching), Eo (on the gallows), Nero au Augustus (descending on golden gravBoots), Podginus (the Copper magistrate)

### The Passage (exact text)
> "No one is offended that I'm bloody and beaten. But when Eo is dragged atop the gallows, there are cries. There are curses. Even now she is beautiful, even drained of the light I saw in her three days ago. Even as she sees me and lets the tears come down her face, she is an angel."

> "As the thirteenth lash falls, as I mumble for her not to do it, Eo stares into my eyes one last moment and then she begins her song. It is a quiet sound, a mournful sound, like the song the deep mines whisper as wind moves in the abandoned shafts. It is the song of death and lament, the song that is forbidden."

> "Podginus glances embarrassedly over at ArchGovernor Augustus, who descends on golden gravBoots to watch more closely. His shining hair glistens against his noble brow. High cheekbones catch the light. Those golden eyes examine my wife as though a worm had suddenly sprouted a butterfly's wings. His scar curves as he speaks with a voice dripping power. 'Let her sing,' he says."

> "But never has Eo been more beautiful to me than in that moment. In the face of cold power, she is fire."

### Shot Breakdown (60-90 seconds)
1. **Wide shot:** Underground mining Common, thousands of Reds packed together, gallows center frame. Gray Tinpots hovering.
2. **Close-up:** Eo's face, tears streaming, seeing Darrow below. Back bloody from lashes.
3. **Darrow POV:** Looking up at her, gagged, struggling. His eyes — terror as he sees the fight building in her.
4. **Medium:** Eo opens her mouth. The first note of the forbidden song. Silence ripples outward.
5. **Slow descent:** Augustus on golden gravBoots, floating down like an angel of death. Golden hair, golden eyes, the Scar. Fascinated, not angry. "Let her sing."
6. **Wide pull-back:** The song echoing through the cavern. Every Red frozen. Even the Tinpots shake their heads.
7. **Extreme close-up:** Darrow's gagged scream. Eo's final look at him — love and purpose.
8. **Cut to black** as the rope goes taut.

## 2. THE CARVING — RED INTO GOLD
**Chapter:** 12 ("The Carving") | **Lines:** ~2312-2610

### Why It's Visually Striking
A body-horror transformation sequence unlike anything in fantasy/sci-fi. Mickey the twelve-fingered Violet artist reshaping a miner's broken body into a golden god. This is Frankenstein meets Pygmalion — the birth of a weapon wrapped in beauty. The mirror reveal is iconic.

### Key Characters
Darrow (being carved), Mickey (the Carver), Evey (the winged Pink girl), Harmony

### The Passage (exact text)
> "My body begins to change. I thicken. My muscles become strong and corded in the concentraction machine. Gradually, strength builds. My shoulders grow broader, rounded; I see tendons emerge in my forearms; a tense mass of hard muscles bind my torso, like armor."

> "And me? It's hard to look at myself in the mirror. I'm what I know the devil to be. I am arrogance and cruelty, the sort of man who killed my wife. I am Gold. And I am as cold as it. My eyes shine like ingots. My skin is soft and rich. My bones are stronger. I feel the density in my lean torso."

> "'You're beautiful,' Evey says quietly, touching my golden Sigils."

> "I am no longer a human. Physically, I've become something more."

> "'Red is rising, Mickey.'"

### Shot Breakdown (60-90 seconds)
1. **Dark medical cell:** Darrow on a slab, patchwork flesh, tubes and machines. Mickey's spindly twelve fingers working.
2. **Time-lapse montage:** Bones reinforced, skin replaced. Darrow's screaming face dissolving into unconsciousness.
3. **Training sequence:** Concentraction machine — Darrow running VR landscapes of Mars, body thickening, transforming.
4. **The mirror scene:** Evey cutting golden hair. Light from above makes her look angelic with her bound wings. She steps back.
5. **Slow reveal:** Camera behind Darrow, looking into mirror. Golden eyes. Perfect skin. The face of the enemy staring back.
6. **Close-up:** Darrow's hand — golden Sigil wings curving along his wrist. He clenches it.
7. **Final shot:** Darrow grabs Mickey's wrists, locks golden eyes with violet ones in the mirror. "Red is rising, Mickey."

## 3. THE JACKAL CUTS OFF HIS OWN HAND
**Chapter:** 41 ("The Jackal") | **Lines:** ~9970-10020

### Why It's Visually Striking
The most shocking moment in the book. A boy pinned to a table by a dagger through his hand calmly negotiates, fails, then begins sawing off his own hand while laughing. This is the scene that defines the Jackal as one of fiction's great villains. Pure horror, pure will.

### Key Characters
Darrow (watching in disbelief), The Jackal/Adrius (pinned to table), Pax (can't watch, then gives him a blade), Sevro and Howlers (surrounding)

### The Passage (exact text)
> "Then he starts to cut. Tears stream down his face as the blood first wells. He's sawing and Pax can't even watch. The Jackal is halfway done when he looks up at me with a sane smile that convinces me of his complete insanity. His teeth chatter. He is laughing, at me, at this, at the pain. I've not met anyone like him. Now I know how Mickey felt when he met me. This is a monster in the flesh of a man."

> "The Jackal is about to break his own wrist to make the job easier when Pax curses and gives him an ionBlade. It will go through in a single stroke. 'Thank you, Pax,' the Jackal says."

> [Then the sonic detonator, Pax taking the blade meant for Darrow:]

> "Pax launches himself forward, not onto the Jackal, but onto me. His weight crushes me, and his body covers mine. I do not see what happens, but I feel it through Pax's body. A shudder. A spasm. Ten impacts as the Jackal stabs at Pax trying furiously to get at me like some rabid animal digging in the dirt, digging through Pax to kill me while I'm down."

> "Blood drips onto my face, warms my body. It is my friend's."

### Shot Breakdown (60-90 seconds)
1. **Tight on the table:** Jackal's hand pinned by dagger. Blood pooling. His face — pale, calm.
2. **Reaction shots:** Howlers circling. Pax eating meat casually. Sevro with knives out.
3. **The negotiation:** Jackal's cold charisma, offering Darrow everything. Darrow refusing.
4. **The cut begins:** Close-up on the Jackal's face. Tears and a smile. The sound of sawing. Pax turning away.
5. **The laugh:** Jackal looks up mid-cut, laughing. Darrow's face — true fear for the first time.
6. **The explosion:** Sonic detonator. Bodies flying. Chaos.
7. **Pax's sacrifice:** Slow-motion — the giant launching himself onto Darrow. Blade impacts through his body. Darrow pinned beneath, blood dripping onto his face.
8. **Silence.** Blood warming Darrow's skin. His friend is dead.

## 4. DARROW BURIES EO UNDER THE STARS
**Chapter:** ~9 (after the hanging) | **Lines:** ~1395-1450

### Why It's Visually Striking
The most tender, quiet scene in the book. A boy carrying his dead wife through silent mine tunnels, past weeping women who reach to touch them both, then through a ventilation duct to the secret garden where they made love — to bury her beneath a tree she never should have seen. The red dirt on his hands matching her hair. Pure grief made physical.

### Key Characters
Darrow (carrying Eo), the women of the Webbery (silent witnesses), Leanna (his sister)

### The Passage (exact text)
> "I take my wife in my arms and together wend our way from the square to the Webbery. A nightshift is working their final hours. The women watch in silence as I carry Eo to the ventilation duct."

> "Women begin to cry, and as I pass they reach to touch Eo's face, to touch mine and help me open the ventilation duct. I drag my wife through the tight metal space, taking her to where we made love beneath the stars, where she told me her plans and I did not listen."

> "I dig a hole near the base of a tree. My hands, covered with the dirt of our land, are red like her hair as I take her hand and kiss her wedding band. I place the outer bulb of the haemanthus atop her heart and take the inner and put it near my own. Then I kiss her lips and bury her. But I sob before I can finish. I uncover her face and kiss her again and hold my body to hers till I see a red sun rising through the artificial bubbleroof."

### Shot Breakdown (60-90 seconds)
1. **The gallows:** Darrow cuts the rope with a stolen slingBlade. Catches Eo's body. Her face pale as chalk, rust-red hair shifting.
2. **The procession:** Long, dark tunnel. Darrow carrying Eo. Women lining the walls in silence. Hands reaching out to touch them both.
3. **The duct:** Darrow pulling Eo's body through a tight metal ventilation shaft. Claustrophobic. Desperate.
4. **The garden:** Emerging into the hidden place — trees, butterflies, artificial sky. Beauty that shouldn't exist underground.
5. **The burial:** Close-up on Darrow's hands digging. Red dirt. Red like her hair. The haemanthus flower placed on her heart.
6. **The kiss:** He buries her, then uncovers her face. Holds her. A red artificial sun rising through the bubbleroof.
7. **Pull back:** One small figure curled around a grave beneath a tree, in a garden hidden beneath a dead planet.

## 5. STORMING OLYMPUS — DARROW VS. JUPITER ON THE MOUNTAIN
**Chapter:** 42 ("War on Heaven") | **Lines:** ~10290-10390

### Why It's Visually Striking
The climactic battle — students invading the Proctors' mountain fortress, Darrow in salvaged armor fighting a fully equipped Proctor in a razor duel that crashes through a window and sends them plummeting into a snowbank on a mountainside. Then Sevro — invisible in a ghostCloak — hamstrings the god. David and Goliath meets Greek mythology on a snow-covered Martian Olympus.

### Key Characters
Darrow (attacking), Jupiter (the Proctor, in golden armor), Sevro (invisible in ghostCloak), the army storming the mountain

### The Passage (exact text)
> "Only my weapons can hurt him. They aren't enough. Jupiter's razor goes through my pulseShield and slips my recoilArmor on the thigh. I hiss with pain and shoot the pulseFist at him."

> "I scream and hack in swirling arcs with my slingBlade even as I stab clumsily with my razor. It's a mad dance."

> "We smash into a holoImmersion room. Sparks fly. I keep screaming and pushing so he cannot rip off my leg with the razor, still limp and looped around flesh and bone. He's backpedaling, off balance, when I take him through a window and we spill out into the open air. Neither of us have gravBoots, so we plummet a hundred feet into a snowbank on the mountain's side."

> "The clouds clear and Jupiter stands before me in the white. Red drips from his golden armor. He is tall, lean, violent."

> "'So I'll cheat.' I nod. 'Go ahead, Sevro.' The razor slithers up from the ground, stiffens, and goes through Jupiter's hamstrings as he wheels about. His slash goes two feet too high. He's used to fighting men."

### Shot Breakdown (60-90 seconds)
1. **Wide:** Olympus mountain fortress. Army swarming up the slopes. Explosions. Chaos.
2. **Interior fight:** Darrow vs. Jupiter. Razors — whip-swords that go rigid and limp. Sparks against golden armor. Darrow screaming, hacking with his slingBlade.
3. **The window crash:** Both warriors smashing through glass, falling — slow-motion — into white void.
4. **Impact:** Snowbank. Rolling down the mountainside toward the drop. Darrow catching himself.
5. **Standoff in the clouds:** Jupiter in golden armor, blood dripping. Darrow battered. Morning breaking behind them on Mars.
6. **The cheat:** Darrow drops his weapons. Smiles. "Go ahead, Sevro." The invisible razor rising from snow. Jupiter falling.
7. **Pull back:** Two figures on the mountainside. A red sweatband on a golden warrior's head. The mountain taken. Olympus fallen.
