## Shot 1: Cutting the Rope (5-8s)
**Prompt:** A young man with rust-red hair and pale scarred skin, wearing a dirty miner's jumpsuit, reaches up with a stolen curved blade and cuts a rope in a dark underground cavern. His face is streaked with tears. Torchlight flickers. Shot on 35mm film, cinematic, warm amber tones.

**Camera:** Low angle looking up, Darrow reaching toward the rope. Slow motion as the blade cuts through.

**Content note:** Avoid showing what's on the rope — start with the cut, then Darrow catching a falling figure.

## Shot 2: The Procession Through the Webbery (8-12s)
**Prompt:** A young red-haired man carries a pale young woman in his arms through a dark mine tunnel. Women in worn work clothes line the walls, reaching out with their hands to touch the pair as they pass. Tears on faces. Dim orange industrial lighting. Underground mining colony. Shot on 35mm film, anamorphic, shallow depth of field.

**Camera:** Slow tracking shot, following Darrow from behind as he walks through the corridor of mourning women. Hands reaching from both sides.

## Shot 3: The Ventilation Duct (5-7s)
**Prompt:** A young man drags a body wrapped in cloth through a tight metal ventilation shaft. Claustrophobic, industrial. Rust and condensation on the walls. His face shows desperate determination. Dim light at the far end. Shot on 35mm film, handheld.

**Camera:** POV from inside the duct, looking back at Darrow pulling Eo through. Tight, intimate, suffocating.

## Shot 4: Emerging Into the Garden (8-10s)
**Prompt:** A young red-haired man emerges from a metal hatch into a hidden underground garden. Trees with green leaves, butterflies, an artificial sky dome overhead showing stars. He carries a pale woman with flowing rust-red hair. The contrast between industrial metal and living nature. Ethereal, dreamlike. Shot on 35mm film, wide lens, golden hour lighting.

**Camera:** Wide establishing shot as Darrow stands in the garden. Pull back to reveal the trees, the artificial sky, the impossible beauty hidden underground.

## Shot 5: Digging the Grave (8-10s)
**Prompt:** Close-up of a young man's hands digging into red Martian soil at the base of a tree. His hands are covered in rusty red dirt. His face is anguished. Tears fall into the earth. A pale woman with rust-red hair lies beside him on the ground, peaceful, with a white flower on her chest. Gentle starlight from above. Shot on 35mm film, intimate macro.

**Camera:** Start tight on hands digging, slowly widen to show Eo lying beside the hole with the haemanthus flower on her heart.

## Shot 6: The Kiss and the Sunrise (10-15s)
**Prompt:** A young red-haired man lies beside a woman in a shallow grave under a tree, holding her body against his, his face pressed to hers. He weeps. Slowly, an artificial red sun begins to rise through a glass dome overhead, casting warm red light across the garden. Red dirt on his hands matching the red of her hair. Shot on 35mm film, warm color grading, slow push-in.

**Camera:** Slow overhead crane shot, pulling upward as red light fills the frame. Two figures entwined beneath the tree.

## Shot 7: Final Wide — One Figure, One Grave (8-10s)
**Prompt:** Extreme wide shot of a hidden underground garden with trees and an artificial starry sky dome. A single small figure sits curled beside a mound of red earth beneath a tree. Ethereal, lonely, vast. The contrast between the immense space and the solitary mourner. Shot on 35mm film, wide anamorphic, cool blue tones with warm center.

**Camera:** Slow pull-back to extreme wide. The figure becomes smaller and smaller. The garden feels infinite and achingly empty.
