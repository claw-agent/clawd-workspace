## Shot 1: The Interrogation Table (5-8s)
**Prompt:** A pale thin young man with sharp aristocratic features sits at a rough wooden table in a stone fortress room. His hand is pinned to the table by a dagger, blood pooling around it. His expression is completely calm — eerily so. Torchlight. Medieval war room with crude maps on walls. Shot on 35mm film, desaturated, cold blue-gray tones.

**Camera:** Medium shot of the Jackal from across the table. His pinned hand in the foreground, his calm face in focus. He's negotiating as if nothing is wrong.

---

## Shot 2: The Howlers Circle (3-5s)
**Prompt:** A group of fierce young warriors in wolf pelts and crude armor surround a table in a stone room. One massive young man — easily seven feet tall, broad as a bear — eats meat casually while watching. A small feral-looking young man with a wolf skull on his head fingers his knives. Torchlight, shadows. Shot on 35mm film, wide, moody.

**Camera:** Wide shot establishing the threat around the table. Pax eating casually. Sevro coiled and ready. The Howlers — wild, dangerous, watching.

---

## Shot 3: The Negotiation (5-8s)
**Prompt:** Close-up of two faces across a table. One: a pale, thin young man with sharp features and cold intelligent eyes, speaking with smooth confidence despite a dagger through his hand. The other: a tall golden-eyed young man listening with growing unease. The pale man is offering something tempting. Torchlight flickers between them. Shot on 35mm film, shot-reverse-shot, shallow depth of field.

**Camera:** Tight alternating close-ups. The Jackal's charisma vs. Darrow's resolve. The Jackal smiling despite the blade through his hand.

---

## Shot 4: He Begins to Cut (8-10s)
**Prompt:** Close-up of a pale young man's face. Tears stream down but he is smiling — a sane smile that proves his complete insanity. He is performing a terrible act of self-mutilation off-screen. His teeth chatter. He is laughing through tears. The sound is horrible. A massive young man in the background turns away, unable to watch. Torchlight. Shot on 35mm film, extreme close-up, unflinching.

**Camera:** Locked on the Jackal's face. We never see the act — only his face. The tears, the smile, the laugh, the chattering teeth. Pax turning away. The SOUND is enough.

**Content note:** Do NOT show the cutting. The Jackal's face IS the horror. Keep everything implied through his expression and the reactions of those watching.

## Shot 5: "Thank You, Pax" (5-8s)
**Prompt:** A massive young man, seven feet tall, reluctantly holds out a glowing energy blade to a pale thin young man whose arm ends in a bloody wrapped stump. The pale man accepts it with a gracious nod and a polite smile, as if being handed a cup of tea. The contrast between the giant's horror and the smaller man's perfect manners is chilling. Torchlight. Shot on 35mm film, medium two-shot.

**Camera:** Two-shot of Pax and the Jackal. The moment of bizarre courtesy. "Thank you, Pax" — said with genuine politeness by a man who just sawed off his own hand.

---

## Shot 6: The Explosion (3-5s)
**Prompt:** A stone fortress room explodes with a sonic shockwave. Bodies and furniture fly outward. Dust and debris fill the air. Chaos, destruction, total pandemonium. Shot on 35mm film, wide angle, high-speed capture, dramatic lighting from the blast.

**Camera:** Wide shot of the room as the sonic detonator goes off. Everything in motion. The world shattered in an instant.

---

## Shot 7: Pax's Sacrifice (10-12s)
**Prompt:** In slow motion, an enormous young man — seven feet tall, broad-shouldered, gentle-faced — launches himself forward onto a fallen golden-eyed warrior, shielding him with his massive body. Behind them, a pale thin figure stabs frantically at the giant's back like a rabid animal, trying to dig through to reach the man beneath. Each impact shudders through the giant's body. Blood begins to drip. Shot on 35mm film, slow motion, desaturated, handheld.

**Camera:** Slow-motion from floor level. Pax's body covering Darrow. The Jackal's frenzied stabbing seen from below — a blur of violence. Pax shuddering with each impact but NOT letting go. Blood dripping onto Darrow's upturned face.

**Content note:** Frame Pax as a shield, not a victim. His choice is heroic. Show the impacts through body shudders and Darrow's face below, not graphic wounds.

---

## Shot 8: Silence — Blood on Darrow's Face (5-8s)
**Prompt:** Extreme close-up of a young man's face lying on a stone floor. Blood drips onto his cheek from above — warm, slow drops. His golden eyes are open, staring upward, filled with shock and grief. The weight of a massive body pins him down. Everything is still. Shot on 35mm film, macro close-up, shallow depth of field, silence.

**Camera:** Locked close-up on Darrow's face. Blood dripping. The weight of his dead friend pressing him into the stone. His eyes say: my friend is dead, and his blood is warm on my face.

### Kling 3.0 Settings
- **Mode:** Multi-Shot (Jackal, Darrow, Pax, Sevro consistent)
- **Element Reference:** Need Jackal ref (pale, thin, sharp features, intelligent eyes) + Pax ref (7ft giant, gentle face)
- **Aspect:** 16:9 cinematic
- **Duration:** 5-12s per shot
- **Negative prompt:** modern clothing, bright colors, clean rooms, daylight, cartoon

### Color Palette
- Throughout: cold stone gray, torchlight amber, desaturated
- Shots 1-5: Controlled, tense (cool tones with warm torch accents)
- Shot 6: White/orange blast
- Shots 7-8: Drained of color. Almost monochrome. Blood is the only warm tone.

### Key Visual Motifs
- **The smile** — Jackal's sanity-proving-insanity grin is THE image
- **Courtesy in horror** — "Thank you, Pax" is more terrifying than the act
- **Shield** — Pax literally becoming a human shield
- **Blood as warmth** — the final line. Warm blood = dead friend
- **Scale** — the Jackal is SMALL but the most dangerous person in the room

### Character Notes (Need Refs)
- **The Jackal/Adrius:** Thin, pale, sharp features. Looks like a scholar, not a warrior. Blonde-gold hair, angular face. Intelligent, cold eyes. The kind of face you'd trust at first glance.
- **Pax:** MASSIVE — 7 feet, broad as a bear. But gentle-faced. The gentlest soul in the hardest body. His size is his love made physical.
- **Sevro:** Small, feral, wolf skull cap. Knife-fighter's build. Wild eyes. Darrow's shadow.
- **Darrow (Gold):** Tall, golden-eyed, golden-brown hair. Wears crude student armor. By this point in the story: hardened, commanding, but still capable of being surprised.
