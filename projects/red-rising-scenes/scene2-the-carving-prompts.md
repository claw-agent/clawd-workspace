## Shot 1: The Slab (5-8s)
**Prompt:** A young man lies on a medical slab in a dark underground laboratory. His body is covered in surgical marks and tubes. Strange alien medical equipment surrounds him. A thin man with impossibly long twelve-fingered hands works delicately on the young man's exposed shoulder. Purple-tinted light. Cyberpunk medical horror. Shot on 35mm film, clinical cold blue, shallow depth of field.

**Camera:** Overhead shot looking down at Darrow on the slab. Mickey's twelve-fingered hands in frame, working. Tubes pulse with fluid. The body is a canvas being remade.

## Shot 2: The Transformation Montage (10-15s)
**Prompt:** Time-lapse montage of a young man's body transforming in a medical chamber. Bones reinforced with metal. Muscles thickening and hardening. Skin smoothing from rough and scarred to flawless. Hair darkening from rust-red to rich golden-brown. The same face, becoming something else entirely. Clinical lighting shifting from cold blue to warm gold. Shot on 35mm film, macro details intercut with wide shots.

**Camera:** Rapid cuts — close-up of bones being reinforced, muscles thickening under skin, eyes changing color behind closed lids. Each cut a little more golden than the last.

**Content note:** Frame as transformation/metamorphosis, not surgical horror. Think butterfly emerging, not operating room.

## Shot 3: The Concentraction Machine (8-10s)
**Prompt:** A muscular young man runs through a vast virtual reality landscape of red Martian canyons and alien terrain. His body is connected to a training machine by neural cables. He's becoming faster, stronger with each stride. The landscape shifts — mountains, plains, forests. His body glistens with sweat, growing more powerful. Holographic, dreamlike. Shot on 35mm film, dynamic motion, anamorphic.

**Camera:** Tracking alongside Darrow as he runs. The VR landscape morphs around him. Cut between the virtual run and his body in the machine — thickening, changing, becoming Gold.

## Shot 4: Evey Cuts His Hair (5-8s)
**Prompt:** A beautiful young woman with delicate bound wings on her back carefully cuts the golden-brown hair of a tall muscular man sitting before a mirror. She has an ethereal, angelic quality. Soft overhead light makes her look divine. The man sits still, staring at what he's becoming. Underground workshop, warm amber lighting. Shot on 35mm film, soft focus, intimate.

**Camera:** Over Evey's shoulder, seeing both her winged silhouette and Darrow's face in the mirror. She steps back. A moment of quiet tenderness.

## Shot 5: The Mirror Reveal (8-10s)
**Prompt:** A tall, powerfully built young man with golden-brown hair and piercing golden eyes stares at his own reflection in a mirror. His skin is flawless, his bone structure perfect — aristocratic, dangerous, beautiful. But his expression is haunted. He doesn't recognize himself. He looks like the men who killed his wife. Underground laboratory, single overhead light. Shot on 35mm film, slow push-in on the reflection.

**Camera:** Start behind Darrow's shoulder looking at the mirror. Slow push-in until the reflection fills the frame. His golden eyes — the enemy's eyes — staring back.

---

## Shot 6: The Golden Sigils (3-5s)
**Prompt:** Extreme close-up of a man's wrist and forearm. Golden wing-shaped tattoo markings — Sigils — curve along the skin. The hand clenches into a fist. The Sigils catch the light. Shot on 35mm film, macro, warm gold highlights.

**Camera:** Tight on the Sigils. The hand clenches. Power contained.

---

## Shot 7: "Red Is Rising" (8-10s)
**Prompt:** A tall golden-eyed man grabs the thin wrists of a violet-eyed artist with twelve fingers. They lock eyes in a mirror — gold meeting violet. The golden man's expression shifts from haunted to resolved, dangerous, purposeful. The thin man looks at his creation with pride and fear. Dark underground lab. Shot on 35mm film, dramatic side lighting, two faces in the mirror.

**Camera:** Push-in on both faces reflected in the mirror. Darrow's grip tightening. Mickey recognizing what he's unleashed. Hold on Darrow's golden eyes as he speaks.

**Narration beat:** *"Red is rising, Mickey."*

## Production Notes

### Narration Script (Claw Voice)
> "My body begins to change. I thicken. My muscles become strong and corded. Gradually, strength builds. My shoulders grow broader. Tendons emerge in my forearms. A tense mass of hard muscles binds my torso... like armor."
>
> [pause]
>
> "And me? It's hard to look at myself in the mirror."
>
> "I'm what I know the devil to be. I am arrogance and cruelty. The sort of man who killed my wife."
>
> "I am Gold. And I am as cold as it."
>
> [pause]
>
> "'You're beautiful,' Evey says quietly, touching my golden Sigils."
>
> [pause]
>
> "I am no longer a human. Physically, I've become something more."
>
> "'Red is rising, Mickey.'"

### Kling 3.0 Settings
- **Mode:** Multi-Shot (Darrow pre/post transformation must feel like same person)
- **Element Reference:** Darrow Red ref for 1-3, Darrow Gold ref for 4-7. Mickey + Evey refs needed.
- **Aspect:** 16:9 cinematic
- **Duration:** 5-10s per shot (extend montage to 15s if possible)
- **Negative prompt:** modern hospital, bright fluorescent, cartoon, anime

### Color Palette
- Shots 1-3: Cold clinical blue/purple (the surgery, the machine)
- Shot 4: Warm amber (Evey's tenderness)
- Shots 5-7: Gold and shadow (the reveal, the new identity)
- Progression: blue → amber → gold mirrors Darrow's transformation

### Key Visual Motifs
- **Metamorphosis** — caterpillar to butterfly, but the butterfly is a weapon
- **The mirror** — identity, recognition, horror at what you've become
- **Hands** — Mickey's twelve fingers creating, Darrow's fist clenching, the grab
- **Color shift** — red to gold, literally and metaphorically
- **Frankenstein echo** — creator looking at creation with pride and terror

### Character Notes
- **Mickey:** Thin, gaunt, twelve fingers on each hand, violet eyes. An artist, not a doctor.
- **Evey:** Pink caste — genetically engineered for beauty. Bound wings on her back (clipped). Angelic, sad.
- **Darrow pre-carving:** Lean, wiry, rust-red hair, rough skin, miner's build.
- **Darrow post-carving:** Tall (6'3"+), broad-shouldered, golden eyes, perfect bone structure. Beautiful and terrifying. Still has the same face — just... refined into something more.
