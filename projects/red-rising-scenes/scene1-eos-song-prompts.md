## Shot 1: The Common — Wide Establishing (5-8s)
**Prompt:** Massive underground cavern lit by orange industrial torches. Thousands of people in worn red mining clothes packed together, facing a wooden gallows at center. Gray-armored soldiers hover overhead on jetpacks. Oppressive, crowded, underground mining colony. Shot on 35mm film, wide anamorphic, warm amber tones, desaturated.

**Camera:** Slow push-in from high wide angle, descending toward the gallows. Crowd noise fading to silence.

## Shot 2: Eo on the Gallows (5-8s)
**Prompt:** Close-up portrait of a beautiful young woman with wild rust-red hair, her back bloody from whip lashes, standing on wooden gallows. Tears stream down her face but her expression shifts from grief to fierce determination. She wears a torn red dress. Underground torchlight. Shot on 35mm film, shallow depth of field, warm tones.

**Camera:** Slow push-in on Eo's face. She sees someone below — tears come — then something hardens in her eyes.

---

## Shot 3: Darrow Below (3-5s)
**Prompt:** A young red-haired man bound and gagged, looking upward with terror in his eyes. His face is bruised and beaten. He strains against ropes. Underground crowd behind him blurred. Torchlight catching tears. Shot on 35mm film, low angle looking up.

**Camera:** Darrow's POV reversed — we see his face looking up at what he can't stop. His eyes say everything.

---

## Shot 4: The First Note (8-10s)
**Prompt:** A young woman with rust-red hair opens her mouth and begins to sing on a wooden platform. The sound is visible in the stillness — the entire cavern of thousands falls silent. Her voice echoes through underground stone chambers. Torchlight flickers. Her back is bloody but she stands tall. Shot on 35mm film, medium shot, anamorphic flares from torchlight.

**Camera:** Medium shot of Eo, then slow pull-back as silence radiates outward through the crowd like a wave. Every face turning to listen.

## Shot 5: Augustus Descends (8-10s)
**Prompt:** A tall aristocratic man with shining golden hair and golden eyes descends slowly through the air on glowing golden boots. He wears regal golden armor with a cape. A curved scar on his face. He examines the singing woman below with cold fascination, like a scientist studying a specimen. Underground cavern, thousands watching. Shot on 35mm film, slow motion, golden light emanating from his boots.

**Camera:** Low angle tracking his descent. He floats down like a fallen angel. The crowd parts beneath him. He speaks: calm, powerful, amused. "Let her sing."

**Content note:** Augustus should radiate cold power and beauty — not cruel, just utterly indifferent to human suffering. Fascinated by the unexpected.

## Shot 6: The Song Fills the Cavern (8-10s)
**Prompt:** Wide shot of a massive underground cavern. A lone young woman sings on a wooden platform, her voice echoing through stone. Thousands of red-clothed workers stand frozen, listening. Gray-armored soldiers shake their heads. A golden figure hovers nearby watching. Torchlight and shadows. The sound feels ancient, mournful, forbidden. Shot on 35mm film, extreme wide, amber and shadow.

**Camera:** Slow overhead crane shot circling the gallows. The song echoes. Every face is changed by it. Even the guards feel something.

---

## Shot 7: The Final Look (5-8s)
**Prompt:** Extreme close-up of a young woman's face, tears and defiance, looking down at someone she loves with absolute purpose. Her rust-red hair frames her face. Behind her eyes: love, and a deliberate choice. Then cut to: a young man's face, gagged, screaming silently, eyes wild with helpless terror. Underground torchlight. Shot on 35mm film, intimate close-ups, shallow depth of field.

**Camera:** Tight on Eo's eyes — love and purpose. Hard cut to Darrow's gagged scream. Hold on his face as realization hits.

---

## Shot 8: The Rope (3-5s)
**Prompt:** Wide shot of a wooden gallows in a torchlit underground cavern. A taut rope. Silence. Thousands of faces looking up. A golden figure hovering nearby. Darkness closing in from the edges of frame. Shot on 35mm film, desaturated, vignette.

**Camera:** Static wide shot. The moment after. Fade to black.

**Content note:** Never show the act directly. The rope going taut, the crowd's reaction, Darrow's face — that's enough. The audience's imagination does the rest.

## Production Notes

### Narration Script (Claw Voice)
> "No one is offended that I'm bloody and beaten. But when Eo is dragged atop the gallows, there are cries. There are curses."
>
> "Even now she is beautiful, even drained of the light I saw in her three days ago."
>
> "As the thirteenth lash falls, as I mumble for her not to do it, Eo stares into my eyes one last moment... and then she begins her song."
>
> "It is a quiet sound. A mournful sound. Like the song the deep mines whisper as wind moves in the abandoned shafts. It is the song of death and lament. The song that is forbidden."
>
> "'Let her sing,' he says."
>
> "But never has Eo been more beautiful to me than in that moment. In the face of cold power... she is fire."
