# Bjorn's Brew Website — Recommendation Document
**Prepared:** January 24, 2026  
**For:** Bjorn's Brew Stakeholders  
**Current Site:** https://site-omega-gilt-81.vercel.app/

## Overview

We conducted two rounds of user testing on the Bjorn's Brew website:
- **Round 1:** 10 consumer personas (demographics-based)
- **Round 2:** 5 UX/design/engineering experts

**Overall Assessment:** The site has a strong brand foundation and emotional appeal. The dog mascot + charity angle is a genuine differentiator. Key improvements focus on user experience clarity and conversion optimization.

## 🔴 High Priority Recommendations

### 1. Remove "Order Online" Button
**Current State:** Button links to non-existent order.bjornsbrew.com  
**Recommendation:** Remove from navbar and any other instances until online ordering is implemented  
**Impact:** Eliminates broken user journey, reduces confusion

### 2. Add Dietary/Milk Alternative Information
**Current State:** Users cannot find oat milk, almond milk, or dietary options  
**Problem:** Health-conscious customers (significant SLC demographic) will bounce  
**Recommendation Options:**
- Add note to menu: "All drinks available with oat, almond, or soy milk (+$0.75)"
- Add dietary filter icons (V = vegan, GF = gluten-free, DF = dairy-free)
- Create "Dietary Options" section in FAQ

**User Quote:** *"I searched for 'oat milk latte' and found nothing. This is a significant miss for the health-conscious SLC crowd."*

### 3. Feature the Pup Cup More Prominently
**Current State:** Mentioned in stats ("1000+ Pup Cups Given") but hard to find on menu  
**Problem:** Dog owners specifically look for this — it's a conversion driver  
**Recommendation:** 
- Add "Pup Cup" as featured item on menu page
- Include in hero or about section
- Consider adding "Bring your pup!" callout on location cards

### 4. Improve CTA Button Contrast
**Current State:** Green buttons blend with green accent color throughout  
**Problem:** Primary actions don't visually "pop"  
**Recommendation:** 
- Use darker green or different accent color for primary CTAs
- Ensure sufficient contrast ratio (4.5:1 minimum)
- Make "Find a Location" more prominent in hero (now primary CTA without Order Online)

## 🟡 Medium Priority Recommendations

### 5. Add Form Validation Feedback
**Current State:** Forms rely on browser defaults, no custom success/error states  
**Recommendation:**
- Add visible validation on contact form
- Show success message after newsletter signup
- Style error states clearly

### 6. Strengthen Testimonials
**Current State:** Generic quotes like "Best coffee in Salt Lake"  
**Recommendation:** Replace with specific, believable quotes:
- ❌ "Great coffee!"
- ✅ "I drive 20 minutes past 3 Starbucks to get their honey lavender latte. Worth it every time." — Sarah M., Sugar House

### 7. Remove Duplicate Newsletter Signup
**Current State:** Newsletter form appears twice (dedicated section + footer)  
**Recommendation:** Keep footer version only, or combine into one prominent placement

### 8. Add Seasonal/Limited-Time Messaging
**Current State:** No urgency or scarcity messaging  
**Recommendation:**
- Feature seasonal drinks: "Winter Spiced Mocha — available through February"
- Highlight new arrivals or limited roasts
- Creates reason to return

### 9. Create Dedicated Catering Page
**Current State:** Catering mentioned in contact form dropdown, no details  
**Recommendation:**
- Add /catering page with packages, pricing, minimums
- Include photos of catering setups
- Clear contact CTA for business inquiries
