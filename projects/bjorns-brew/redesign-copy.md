## 2. Renamed Menu Items

### Blended Drinks

| Current Name | Renamed | Rationale |
|--------------|---------|-----------|
| Latte Frappe | **Frozen Velvet Latte** | "Velvet" = sensory; "Frozen" = clear descriptor |
| Vanilla Chai Frappe | **Spiced Chai Freeze** | "Spiced" evokes warmth; "Freeze" is more playful |
| Smoothies | **Fruit Refreshers** | Elevates from generic; implies freshness |
| Beehive Protein Shake | **The Beehive** 🐝 | Simplify; icon adds visual interest |
| MVP Protein Shake | **The MVP** (Plant Power) | Clarify vegan positioning with subtitle |

### Food Items

| Current Name | Renamed | Rationale |
|--------------|---------|-----------|
| Bjorn's Breakfast Burrito | **The Bjorn Burrito** | Shorter, punchier, memorable |
| Bjorn's Best Burrito | **Bjorn's Best** ⭐ | Mark as signature; remove redundant "burrito" |
| Stuffed Croissants | **Loaded Croissants** | "Loaded" implies generous portions |
| Ham & Cheese Croissant | **The Classic** | Simple, approachable naming |
| Everything Croissant | **Everything Loaded** | Playful double meaning |
| Power Balls | **Energy Bites** | More appetizing; industry-standard term |
| Fruit Parfait | **Morning Parfait** | Positions for daypart; suggests freshness |

### Protein Shakes — Detailed

**The Beehive** 🐝
- Current: "Beehive Protein Shake"
- Keep the honey/bee theme — it's distinctive and local

**The MVP** 💪
- Current: "MVP Protein Shake"  
- Add: *(100% Plant-Based)*
- Speaks directly to vegan customers without alienating others

## 9. Tone Examples — Do's and Don'ts

### ✅ DO

- "The works" — casual, friendly
- "Grab-and-go fuel" — practical, energetic
- "Make it yours" — empowering, personal

### ❌ DON'T

- "Artisanally crafted small-batch espresso" — too pretentious
- "Blended coffee beverage" — too corporate
- "Premium protein shake" — generic, overused
- "Delicious and refreshing!" — empty superlatives

---

## 10. Implementation Notes

### For Design Team
- Descriptions should be in lighter weight or smaller size than item names
- Use em-dashes (—) for description breaks
- Icons (⭐🐝💪🐾) can be literal emoji OR custom illustrated versions
- SF indicator should be subtle but visible

### For Staff Training
- Staff should know the story behind "The Beehive" (local honey source)
- Encourage describing items using menu language
- Practice: "That's our most popular — silky espresso frozen to perfection"

### For Future Updates
- Rotate "Bjorn's Pick" monthly
- Update mission line with donation milestones
- Seasonal descriptions should follow same voice guidelines
