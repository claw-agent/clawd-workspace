## Comprehensive Research Report for Bjorn's Brew

*Compiled: January 24, 2026*

---

## Executive Summary

This report synthesizes research from leading menu engineering consultants, behavioral psychology studies, and design experts to provide actionable recommendations for coffee shop menu board design. The findings reveal that a well-engineered menu can increase profits by **10-15% on an ongoing basis** (Gregg Rapp, Menu Engineers) and that customers make **up to 90% of their assessment based on color alone** within the first 90 seconds of viewing (Emerald Insight research).

## 1. Psychology of Menu Design

### 1.1 The Golden Triangle

When customers view a menu, their eyes follow a predictable pattern known as the **"Golden Triangle"**:

1. **Center** – Eyes move here first
2. **Top Right** – Second area of focus
3. **Top Left** – Third area of focus

**Source:** Aaron Allen & Associates, "The Psychology of Restaurant Menu Design"

**Actionable Recommendation:** Place your highest-margin, signature drinks in these three zones. For a coffee shop menu board, consider placing specialty espresso drinks or seasonal offerings in the center, with premium coffee selections at top right.

### 1.2 Eye Movement Patterns by Menu Configuration

According to menu engineer Gregg Rapp:

| Menu Type | Customer Behavior | Engineering Impact |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **One-panel** | Faster decisions, lower ordering volume | Lower profitability per customer |
| **Two-panel** | Optimal balance; feels like full experience | Best for menu engineering |
| **Three-panel** | Valid for many items, harder to read | Moderate engineering control |
| **Many-panel** | Overwhelming; customers default to familiar items | Least control over decisions |

**Source:** Menu Cover Depot, "Menu Engineering: How to Raise Restaurant Profits 15% or More"

**Actionable Recommendation:** For a coffee shop menu board, aim for a **two-panel visual structure** even on a single board—divide into clear left/right or top/bottom sections.

### 1.3 The Burden of Choice (Decision Fatigue)

When confronted with too many options, customers:
- Have difficulty deciding
- Are more likely to be unsatisfied with their choice
- Default to the most common/familiar item (which is often the least profitable)

**Optimal number of items per section: 5-7 items**

**Source:** Lightspeed HQ, "Menu Engineering: How to Make a Profitable Restaurant Menu"

**Actionable Recommendation:** Limit each menu category (espresso drinks, drip coffee, specialty drinks, food) to **7 items maximum**. Consider rotating seasonal items rather than adding to the permanent menu.

### 1.4 The Power of Positioning

- **Top 2 items** in each section are ordered most frequently
- **Last item** in each section gets significant attention
- **Middle items** (positions 3-5 in a 6-item list) receive the least attention

**Source:** Menu Cover Depot, Gregg Rapp interview

**Actionable Recommendation:** 
- Position **highest-margin drinks first** in each category
- Place your **third-most-profitable item last**
- Use middle positions for "plow-horses" (popular but lower-margin items)

## 2. Typography and Readability

### 2.1 Core Typography Principles for Menu Boards

**Font Selection Guidelines:**

| Element | Recommendation | Rationale |
|---------|---------------|-----------|
| **Headlines/Categories** | Sans-serif, bold weight | Maximum legibility at distance |
| **Item Names** | Sans-serif or readable serif | Clear distinction from descriptions |
| **Descriptions** | Sans-serif, regular weight | Readability; avoid script fonts |
| **Prices** | Same font as descriptions | Reduces price emphasis |

**Recommended Sans-Serif Families:**
- Helvetica / Helvetica Neue
- Gotham
- Proxima Nova
- Futura
- Avenir

### 2.2 Viewing Distance Calculations

**Rule of Thumb:** For every 10 feet of viewing distance, increase font size by 1 inch for primary text.

| Viewing Distance | Minimum Font Height |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| 10 feet | 1 inch |
| 20 feet | 2 inches |
| 30 feet | 3 inches |

**Contrast Requirements:**
- Minimum contrast ratio of **4.5:1** for standard text
- **7:1** for optimal readability
- Dark text on light background typically provides better readability than reverse

### 2.3 Hierarchy and Spacing

**Visual Hierarchy (in order of prominence):**
1. Category headers (largest, boldest)
2. Item names
3. Prices
4. Descriptions (if space allows)

**Spacing Guidelines:**
- **Line spacing:** 120-150% of font size
- **Category separation:** 2x the spacing between items
- **Padding around highlighted items:** Equal on all sides

**Source:** Typography best practices compiled from design standards

**Actionable Recommendation:** For a typical coffee shop counter with 10-15 foot viewing distance:
- Category headers: 2-3 inches
- Item names: 1-1.5 inches
- Prices: 0.75-1 inch

## 3. Color Psychology in Food & Beverage Contexts

### 3.1 Color Associations and Emotions

Research from Frontiers in Psychology and Shopify studies shows:

| Color | Primary Associations | Food/Beverage Application |
|-------|---------------------|--------------------------|
| **Brown** | Warmth, earth, coffee, comfort | Ideal for coffee shops; signals authenticity |
| **Orange** | Optimism, energy, stimulation | Great for breakfast/morning offerings |
| **Yellow** | Joy, happiness, creativity | Use sparingly; too much can overwhelm |
| **Green** | Freshness, health, calm | Signals organic/natural offerings |
| **Red** | Urgency, passion, appetite stimulation | Effective for LTOs and specials |
| **Blue** | Trust, calm, reliability | Use for brand elements, not food items |
| **Black** | Premium, sophisticated, bold | Effective for specialty/premium items |
| **White** | Purity, cleanliness, simplicity | Essential for negative space |

**Source:** Shopify, "Color Psychology in Marketing"; Science of People, "Color Psychology Research"

### 3.2 The "90-Second Rule"

Research indicates that **62-90% of a customer's first impression** is based on color alone, and this assessment happens within **90 seconds** of initial viewing.

**Source:** Emerald Insight research, cited by Lightspeed HQ

### 3.3 Color Combinations for Coffee Shops

**Recommended Palettes:**

**Classic Coffeehouse:**
- Primary: Deep brown (#5D4037)
- Secondary: Cream/Tan (#D7CCC8)
- Accent: Burnt orange (#E64A19)

**Modern Nordic (Aligned with "Bjorn's" Nordic theme):**
- Primary: Charcoal gray (#37474F)
- Secondary: Natural wood tones/tan
- Accent: Forest green (#2E7D32) or deep blue (#1565C0)

**Artisan/Craft:**
- Primary: Black or dark slate
- Secondary: White/cream
- Accent: Gold or copper tones

**Actionable Recommendation:** For Bjorn's Brew, consider a Nordic-inspired palette that evokes:
- **Warmth** (browns, wood tones) for comfort
- **Nature** (greens, earth tones) for authenticity
- **Simplicity** (clean whites, grays) for Scandinavian aesthetic

### 3.4 Colors to Avoid

- **Blue as the dominant color** – Suppresses appetite; signals cold
- **Neon or overly bright colors** – Appear cheap; cause eye fatigue
- **Purple as primary** – Associated with luxury but can seem artificial in food contexts

## 4. Pricing Presentation Strategies

### 4.1 The #1 Mistake: Price Columns

**Never list prices in a column on the right side of the menu.**

This causes customers to:
- Focus on price instead of offerings
- Scan for the cheapest option
- Choose based on cost rather than desire

**Source:** Menu Cover Depot; Aaron Allen & Associates

### 4.2 Optimal Price Presentation

**Recommended Techniques:**

1. **Nested Pricing:** Place price 2 spaces after description, same font size and style
   - Example: "House Blend - Single origin Ethiopian, bright and fruity 4.50"

2. **Remove Dollar Signs:** Studies show removing "$" can increase spending up to 30%
   - Use: "4.50" not "$4.50"
   - Never write out "dollars"

3. **Strategic Rounding:**
   - **Charm pricing** (4.95, 4.99): Signals value/deals
   - **Round numbers** (5.00, 6.00): Signals premium quality
   - For specialty coffee shops, round numbers often work better

**Source:** Aaron Allen & Associates, "Psychology of Menu Design"

### 4.3 The Decoy Effect

Place a slightly more expensive item at the top of a category to make other items appear more reasonably priced.

**Example Structure:**
- Premium Single-Origin Pour-Over    6.50
- House Blend Drip Coffee            3.75
- Coffee of the Day                  3.25

The premium option makes the house blend seem like excellent value.

### 4.4 Price Anchoring for Coffee Shops

Create clear price tiers that guide customers toward middle-priced (typically highest-margin) options:

| Tier | Example | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Premium** | $6-7 | Anchors perception; attracts enthusiasts |
| **Standard** | $4-5 | Target tier; best margins |
| **Entry** | $2.50-3.50 | Accessibility; converts new customers |

## 5. Coffee Shop Menu Board Best Practices

### 5.1 Coffee-Specific Design Considerations

**Unique Challenges:**
- Counter ordering (customers need to decide quickly)
- Often viewed from a queue (varying distances)
- Morning rush = decision fatigue amplification
- Many similar-sounding drinks (latte, cappuccino, flat white)

**Solutions:**

1. **Clear Categorization:**
   - Espresso Drinks
   - Drip Coffee / Filter
   - Cold Drinks
   - Specialty / Seasonal
   - Food

2. **Size Pricing Clarity:**
   - Display all sizes with prices
   - Or indicate base size with "+$X for large"

3. **Modifiers Section:**
   - Alternative milks
   - Extra shots
   - Flavor additions

### 5.2 What Top Coffee Shops Do

Based on industry analysis:

| Practice | Adoption Rate | Impact |
|----------|--------------|--------|
| **Signature drink highlighting** | High | Creates differentiation; improves margins |
| **Limited menu** (under 25 items) | Growing | Faster decisions; better experience |
| **Seasonal rotation** | Standard | Drives repeat visits; generates buzz |
| **Visual hierarchy** | Essential | Reduces confusion; speeds ordering |
| **Story/origin information** | Premium shops | Justifies pricing; builds connection |

### 5.3 Digital vs. Static Menu Boards

**Digital Menu Board Benefits:**
- **28% higher ROI** on average vs. static boards
- Easy updates for seasonal items, out-of-stock items
- Dynamic pricing (e.g., happy hour)
- Visual appeal with motion/images

**When Digital Works Best:**
- High-traffic locations
- Frequently changing menus
- Multiple dayparts (breakfast, lunch, etc.)

**When Static Works Best:**
- Artisan/craft positioning
- Budget constraints
- Simple, unchanging menu
- Small spaces

**Source:** Aaron Allen & Associates (Burger King case study: 64% sales increase with digital boards)

**Actionable Recommendation:** If budget allows, consider a hybrid approach—digital for specials/seasonal items, static for core menu items.

## 6. Menu Engineering Matrix

### 6.1 The Four Quadrants

Categorize every menu item by profitability and popularity:

```
                    HIGH POPULARITY
                          │
         PLOW-HORSES      │      STARS
        (Low profit,      │    (High profit,
         high sales)      │     high sales)
                          │
    ──────────────────────┼──────────────────────
                          │
           DOGS           │      PUZZLES
        (Low profit,      │    (High profit,
         low sales)       │     low sales)
                          │
                    LOW POPULARITY
```

### 6.2 Strategy by Quadrant

| Quadrant | Strategy | Menu Board Tactics |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **STARS** | Promote heavily | Prime positioning; visual callouts; highlight boxes |

## 7. Visual Merchandising Techniques

### 7.1 Eye Magnets

Use graphic elements to draw attention to specific items:

- **Boxes/Frames:** Increase item sales up to **30%** when used sparingly
- **Icons:** ★ for signatures, 🍃 for plant-based, ❄ for cold drinks
- **Color blocks:** Highlight background for featured items
- **Photography:** Can increase sales 30% (but may cheapen premium perception)

**Critical Rule:** Use only **1-2 eye magnets per panel/section**. Overuse negates the effect.

**Source:** Gregg Rapp, Menu Engineers

### 7.2 Negative Space (White Space)

Items set apart in their own space receive significantly more attention than items crowded together.

**Application:**
- Surround signature drinks with extra padding
- Don't fill every inch of the menu board
- Allow eye rest between sections

### 7.3 Material and Presentation

The physical material communicates brand values:

| Material | Signal | Best For |
|----------|--------|----------|
| **Chalkboard** | Artisan, handcrafted, fresh | Local/independent shops |
| **Wood/natural materials** | Authentic, warm, sustainable | Nordic/craft positioning |
| **Matte black/white** | Modern, premium, clean | Contemporary specialty |
| **Backlit acrylic** | Professional, bright, clear | High-traffic, larger spaces |
| **Digital screens** | Dynamic, tech-forward | Fast-casual, chains |

**Actionable Recommendation:** For Bjorn's Brew's Nordic positioning, consider:
- Natural wood frame or backing
- Matte finishes (not glossy)
- Clean, minimalist layout
- Perhaps a hand-lettered accent for seasonal items

---

## 8. Descriptions and Copywriting

### 8.1 The Power of Descriptions

Properly written descriptions can increase sales of specific items by **27%** or more.

**Effective Description Elements:**
- **Sensory adjectives:** "velvety," "bold," "bright," "smooth"
- **Origin stories:** "Single-origin Ethiopian Yirgacheffe"
- **Process details:** "slow-roasted," "cold-brewed for 18 hours"
- **Emotional triggers:** "perfect for a cold morning"

### 8.2 Description Guidelines for Menu Boards

Given space constraints on menu boards:

| Item Type | Description Approach |
|-----------|---------------------|
| **Signature items** | 4-8 words; sensory + unique element |
| **Standard items** | 2-4 words; basic ingredients |
| **Specialty items** | Full origin/story (on separate card if needed) |

**Examples:**
- ✓ "House Latte – Silky espresso, steamed milk, hint of sweetness"
- ✓ "Cold Brew – 18-hour steeped, smooth & bold"
- ✗ "Coffee with milk and foam" (too generic)

### 8.3 Avoid These Copywriting Mistakes

1. **Superlatives:** "The world's best coffee" – ignored by customers
2. **Generic descriptions:** Same words as every other café
3. **Jargon overload:** Not everyone knows what "third-wave" means
4. **Ingredient lists:** Recipes belong in the kitchen, not the menu

## 9. Testing and Iteration

### 9.1 The Importance of Testing

Menu engineering is not a one-time project. Leading restaurants:
- Review menu performance **twice per year minimum**
- A/B test positioning and descriptions
- Track item-level sales data
- Adjust based on changing costs and trends

### 9.2 Key Metrics to Track

| Metric | What It Tells You | Target |
|--------|-------------------|--------|
| **Sales per item** | Popularity | Identify stars and dogs |
| **Gross margin per item** | Profitability | Guide pricing decisions |
| **Category mix** | Balance | No category >40% of sales |
| **Average ticket** | Upselling success | Track post-menu changes |
| **Speed of service** | Menu complexity impact | Monitor during rush |

### 9.3 Staff Training

Your menu board is only as effective as your staff's ability to sell it.

**Training Requirements:**
- Every team member should taste signature items
- Staff should know top 3 items to recommend
- Train on upselling (sizes, add-ons, pairings)
- Weekly "menu moment" in team meetings
