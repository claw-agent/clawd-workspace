## The Opportunity

Gap between "AI Normies" (use tools, can't think in systems) and "AI Nerds" (technically deep, can't communicate).

**AI Advisors** bridge both: deep enough to solve, smart enough to communicate.

---

## The Offer: 2-Hour AI Audit

**Pitch:**
> "Walk into a business, look at their operations for 2 hours, say 'this process right here? AI cuts it by 40% and here's exactly how'"

**Format:**
1. 2-hour operations review (Zoom or in-person)
2. Identify top 3 automation opportunities
3. Deliverable: Report with specific processes, % improvement, implementation roadmap

**Pricing Ideas:**
- One-time audit: $500-2,000
- Implementation package: $5,000-20,000
- Retainer (ongoing optimization): $1,000-3,000/mo

## Target Markets

1. **Local businesses** — Same as lead gen targets (old websites = old processes)
2. **Agencies** — Help them become "AI-native"
3. **Professional services** — Law, accounting, real estate

---

## Our Competitive Edge

- Actually use these tools daily (OpenClaw, agents, automation)
- Can demo real workflows, not just theory
- Technical depth + business communication

---

## When to Activate

- After lead gen pipeline is generating consistent revenue
- If consulting opportunities arise naturally from lead gen clients
- When Marb has bandwidth for higher-touch services
