  "body": "Hi there,\n\nI came across Beehive Plumbing while researching home services in Salt Lake City, and I wanted to reach out with an idea.\n\nYour business has solid reviews (4.8 stars!), but I think your online presence could be working harder for you. A few quick improvements could help you:\n\n• Show up higher in Google searches\n• Convert more website visitors into phone calls\n• Stand out from competitors\n\nI put together a quick demo showing one approach:\n[Demo URL]\n\nThis is just a concept - no pressure at all. But if you're curious about what it would take to implement something like this, I'd be happy to chat.\n\nI work specifically with home services businesses in Utah, so I understand your market and what works.\n\nWorth a conversation?\n\nBest,\n[Your Name]\n\nP.S. - I noticed you've been in business for 10+ years. That kind of experience deserves a website that reflects it!",
