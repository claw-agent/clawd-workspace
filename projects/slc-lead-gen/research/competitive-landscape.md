# SLC Lead Gen - Competitive Landscape Brief
*Intel Report: January 2026*

---

## Executive Summary

The Salt Lake City web design and lead gen market is **crowded but fragmented**. There are 20+ agencies competing, but most fall into two camps:
1. **Enterprise-focused agencies** (targeting mid-market to Fortune 500)
2. **Generic WordPress shops** (commodity service, race to bottom)

**The gap we can exploit:** Very few agencies focus specifically on **SMB lead generation with measurable ROI guarantees**. Most sell "web design" rather than "customer acquisition."

---

## Market Gaps & Opportunities

### 🎯 Gap 1: Performance-Based Pricing
**Nobody offers pay-for-leads or revenue share models.** All agencies use hourly/project/retainer. This is risky for SMBs who don't know if it'll work.

**Our play:** Offer hybrid model with base + performance bonus tied to leads generated.

---

### 🎯 Gap 2: Industry Vertical Focus
**Most agencies are generalists** trying to serve everyone. Only Webtek has clear industry pages (legal, healthcare, etc.).

**Our play:** Dominate 2-3 high-value verticals (contractors, professional services, property management). Build industry-specific landing pages, case studies, and lead magnets.

---

### 🎯 Gap 3: Speed to Value
**Most agencies have 4-12 week timelines.** For an SMB bleeding cash without leads, that's too slow.

**Our play:** "Website live in 5 days, leads in 30" - rapid deployment model with pre-built templates we customize.

---

### 🎯 Gap 4: Transparent Pricing
**Everyone hides pricing.** "Request a quote" is the norm. This creates friction and favors tire-kickers.

**Our play:** Publish clear pricing tiers on the website. Show what they get. Remove uncertainty.

---

### 🎯 Gap 5: Lead Gen vs Web Design Framing
**Everyone sells "websites."** Very few explicitly sell "more customers" or "lead generation."

**Our play:** Position as a **lead generation company that happens to build websites** - not a web design agency that does marketing.

---

### 🎯 Gap 6: Done-For-You Local SEO
**SEO services exist but are often add-ons.** No one bundles website + ongoing local SEO + Google Business optimization as a single package.

**Our play:** All-in-one local visibility package - website, GMB optimization, review generation, local citations. One price, full service.

---

## Recommended Positioning

### Primary Message
> "We don't build websites. We build lead machines. Pay only when it works."

### Key Differentiators
1. **Performance-based pricing** (base + bonus for leads)
2. **5-day launch** (speed to value)
3. **Vertical specialization** (contractors, professional services)
4. **Transparent pricing** (published on website)
5. **All-in-one local visibility** (website + SEO + GMB + reviews)

### Tagline Options
- "Leads or it's free"
- "Your next 10 customers, guaranteed"
- "Websites that pay for themselves"
- "Stop paying for websites. Start paying for customers."
