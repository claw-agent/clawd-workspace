# Follow-up Email #1 (Day 3)

**Subject:** Quick follow-up on that {{business_name}} demo

---

Hi {{first_name}},

Just wanted to make sure my last email didn't get lost in the shuffle.

I put together a demo site for {{business_name}} that addresses {{brief_issue}}:

**👉 {{demo_url}}**

I know you're busy running a business, so I'll keep this short — the demo is there whenever you have 2 minutes to look.

Happy to answer any questions if you have them.
