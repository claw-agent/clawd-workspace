# Breakup Email (Day 14)

**Subject:** Should I close your file?

---

Hi {{first_name}},

I've reached out a few times about the demo site I built for {{business_name}}, but haven't heard back.

No hard feelings at all — I know website stuff isn't always the top priority when you're running a business.

I'm going to close out your file, but the demo will stay live for another 30 days if you ever want to check it out:

**{{demo_url}}**

If things change or you want to revisit this down the road, just reply to this email. I'll be around.

Wishing you and {{business_name}} all the best,
{{sender_name}}
