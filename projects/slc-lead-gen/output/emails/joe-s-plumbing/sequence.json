If not, no worries at all — consider it a free gift.\n\nCheers,\nMarb\n\nP.S. I noticed you have 47 reviews on Google — that's solid social proof that'll look great on the new site.\n",

But if you've been meaning to look and just haven't had a chance, here's what stood out:\n\n• Mobile-optimized layout that works on any device\n• Lightning-fast load times (under 2 seconds)\n• Secure HTTPS connection (no scary browser warnings)\n\nEither way, I won't keep bugging you. Just wanted to make sure you had the chance to see what's possible.\n\nBest,\nMarb\n",

I'll be around.\n\nWishing you and Joe's Plumbing all the best,\nMarb\n",
