**Subject:** I built Joe's Plumbing a demo site (your mobile site might be turning away customers)

---

Hi Joe,

I was checking out Joe's Plumbing's website and noticed something that might be costing you customers.

Your site doesn't look great on phones — and with 60% of local searches happening on mobile, that's likely costing you leads.

Instead of just pointing this out, I went ahead and built you a quick demo showing what your site could look like with these issues fixed:

No sales pitch, no obligation — I just thought you'd want to see it.

If you like what you see and want to chat about making it live, I'm happy to hop on a quick call. If not, no worries at all — consider it a free gift.

Cheers,
Marb

P.S. I noticed you have 47 reviews on Google — that's solid social proof that'll look great on the new site.
