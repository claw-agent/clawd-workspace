**Subject:** Last thing about Joe's Plumbing's website

---

Hi Joe,

I'll keep this super quick.

I built a demo for Joe's Plumbing about a week ago (here's the link again: https://demo.example.com/joe-s-plumbing).

If the timing isn't right, I totally get it. But if you've been meaning to look and just haven't had a chance, here's what stood out:

• Mobile-optimized layout that works on any device
• Lightning-fast load times (under 2 seconds)
• Secure HTTPS connection (no scary browser warnings)

Either way, I won't keep bugging you. Just wanted to make sure you had the chance to see what's possible.

Best,
Marb
