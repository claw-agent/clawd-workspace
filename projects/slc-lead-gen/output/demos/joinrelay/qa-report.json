  "strengths": [
    "Tone and messaging is warm, supportive, and non-judgmental - appropriate for recovery context",
    "Core value proposition clearly communicated (group-based, accountability, community)",

    "Responsive Tailwind classes should provide good mobile experience",
    "Visual design is clean and professional with consistent color scheme",
    "Sensitive topic handled respectfully without being preachy"
  ],
  "summary": "The site has strong foundational copy that matches the brand's supportive, hopeful tone, but has critical rendering issues (unprocessed templates, duplicated text) and accuracy problems (fabricated pricing, wrong B2B language for B2C product, fake testimonials). The template system failed to process properly, leaving Handlebars syntax visible. Cannot deploy in current state - requires template processing fixes and removal of fabricated pricing/testimonials."
