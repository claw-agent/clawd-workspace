    "mainStory": "You've tried to quit alone, and it hasn't worked—not because you're weak, but because isolation is where addiction thrives. Relay is the breakthrough: a structured community where real people find real freedom together. You're not broken, you're just fighting the wrong battle. Join the thousands who discovered that lasting change happens in connection, not isolation.",
    "emotionalHook": "The relief of finally not being alone in this struggle—combined with the hope that change is genuinely possible when you have the right support system. We tap into the exhaustion of failed solo attempts and offer the liberating truth: you were never meant to fight this alone.",
    "transformation": "From isolated shame and endless failed attempts → to supported, accountable, and genuinely free. From 'I can't stop' → to 'I have the tools, the people, and the path to lasting freedom.'",
    "openingAngle": "Problem-acknowledgment with immediate hope. We validate the struggle without dwelling in it—quickly pivoting to the solution. Not doom-and-gloom, but 'we understand, and here's the way forward.'"
