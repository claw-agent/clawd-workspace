      "suggestion": "Replace icon path data with actual SVG paths from Lucide, Heroicons, or similar icon library. For example, 'zap' should be a proper lightning bolt path."

      "description": "Features section contains duplicate content - the same 6 features are listed twice, once with broken icon paths and again with generic Heroicon paths.",
      "suggestion": "Remove the duplicate feature blocks. Keep only one set of 6 features with working icons."

      "description": "Hero headline structure is awkward - 'PHI Sanitization That Never Leaves Your Network' followed by standalone 'Never Leaves' creates redundant, confusing text.",
      "suggestion": "Either highlight 'Never Leaves' within the main headline or restructure to avoid repetition."

  "strengths": [
    "Copy accurately represents Glendor's core value proposition and technical capabilities",
    "Professional healthcare-industry tone with appropriate terminology (PHI, BAA, at-source)",
    "Benefits section effectively uses 'Status Quo vs. Glendor' comparison format from original brand voice",
    "How It Works section provides clear 4-step process explanation",
    "Footer tagline 'On a quest to safeguard patients' privacy' correctly pulled from research",
    "Responsive Tailwind structure should work well on mobile devices",
    "Color scheme (#6aad8e green) extracted appropriately from brand"
  ],
  "summary": "The copy quality is strong and accurately represents Glendor's PHI sanitization offering, but the HTML implementation has critical rendering issues. Broken SVG icons and duplicate feature blocks will make the page look unprofessional. The 'Home Page' placeholder text appearing as the business name is a significant oversight. These are likely template/generation bugs rather than content issues. The page cannot ship without fixing the icons and removing duplicates."
