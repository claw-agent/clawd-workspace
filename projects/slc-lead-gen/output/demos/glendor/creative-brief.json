    "mainStory": "Healthcare organizations are trapped between two bad options: painstakingly manual de-identification that doesn't scale, or sending sensitive patient data to third-party clouds and praying nothing goes wrong. Glendor breaks this false choice by bringing fully automatic PHI sanitization directly to where your data lives—no exposure, no templates, no bottlenecks.",
    "emotionalHook": "The quiet dread of data exposure. Every healthcare leader knows that one breach, one HIPAA violation, one patient's information leaked can unravel years of trust. Glendor offers relief from that constant low-grade anxiety by ensuring PHI never leaves your walls in the first place.",
    "transformation": "From 'data sharing is a liability we manage' to 'data sharing is a capability we leverage.' Organizations move from defensive, risk-averse data practices to confidently unlocking the research, AI training, and collaboration potential of their medical data.",
    "openingAngle": "Problem-first with immediate solution contrast. Lead with the broken status quo (manual work, cloud risk, template fragility) then pivot sharply to 'there's now a third option' positioning. This validates the audience's existing frustrations before introducing the product."

Avoid red (alarm/danger connotations in healthcare contexts).",
    "imageStyle": "Clean, abstract, technical illustrations over photography. Think: simplified network diagrams, data flow visualizations, iconographic representations of medical modalities. If using photography, choose clinical/research environments (labs, imaging suites) rather than patient-facing healthcare imagery. No smiling doctors with tablets.",
    "iconStyle": "Duotone or line icons with the primary green as accent. Modern, minimal, consistent stroke weight. Icons should feel precise and technical—appropriate for a security/compliance product. Consider custom icons for the comparison table (checkmarks vs. warning indicators).",
    "overallFeel": "Clinical confidence. Clean, structured, with generous whitespace. The design should feel like enterprise software that takes itself seriously—not a consumer app, not a legacy system. Think: modern health tech (Oscar, Flatiron) rather than traditional healthcare vendor. The comparison section can be more visually dynamic to highlight the contrast."
