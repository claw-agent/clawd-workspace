    "whatItDoes": "Glendor PHI Sanitizer is software that automatically redacts Protected Health Information (PHI) from multimodal medical data including medical images (pixels and metadata), pathology, reports, videos, photos, and voice recordings.",
    "problemSolved": "Healthcare organizations need to share medical data for research, AI training, and collaboration, but manually de-identifying PHI is non-scalable, time-consuming, and risky. Current alternatives (manual redaction, templates, 3rd party cloud services) are either labor-intensive, fragile, or expose unredacted data to external parties.",
    "howItWorks": "Fully automatic in situ (on-premise/customer cloud) redaction that processes medical data at the source without requiring templates, manual intervention, or sending data to third parties. Designed to integrate as a node into existing data workflows or operate as a standalone tool."
