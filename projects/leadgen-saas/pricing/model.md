2. **Predictable** — No surprise bills, clear credit limits
3. **Growth-friendly** — Easy to upgrade, no punishment for success
4. **Transparent** — Publish pricing, no "contact sales" gate for SMBs

## Pricing Psychology

### Anchoring
- Lead with Scale ($799) to make Growth ($299) feel reasonable
- Show per-lead math ($0.12/lead vs hiring SDR at $50K/year)

### Loss Aversion
- "Your unused credits expire" → motivates usage
- "Limited spots for beta pricing" → urgency

### Social Proof
- Show customer logos on pricing page
- Display "Most Popular" on Growth tier
- Include testimonials near price

### Simplicity
- No per-seat pricing (encourages team adoption)
- No complex credit calculations (unlike Clay)
- One number, one price

---

## Discount Strategy

### Who Gets Discounts
| Segment | Discount | Reason |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Annual prepay | 17% | Cash flow, commitment |
| Startups (<10 employees) | 25% | Land-and-expand |
| Non-profits | 30% | Goodwill, case studies |
| Agencies (5+ clients) | Custom | Volume partnership |

### Who Doesn't Get Discounts
- Large enterprises (they'll pay full price)
- "Just testing" (use free trial instead)
- Price shoppers (not our ICP)

---

## A/B Test Ideas

1. **Pricing page layout:** Feature comparison vs. simple tiers
2. **Annual discount:** 17% vs 20% vs "2 months free"
3. **Free trial length:** 7 days vs 14 days
4. **Credit amounts:** 500 vs 750 vs 1,000 for Starter
5. **Add-on bundling:** LinkedIn as separate vs. included in Scale
