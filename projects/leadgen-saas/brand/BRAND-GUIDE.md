## 1. Product Name Options

#### 1. **Wellspring**
*"The source of your sales pipeline"*

| Criteria | Assessment |
|----------|------------|

| **Trademark** | Low risk (generic word, different industries) |
| **Gut Rating** | **8/10** — Evokes continuous flow, source, abundance |

**Why it works:** Metaphorically powerful. A wellspring is a natural source that continuously produces—exactly what a lead gen tool should do. Feels premium without being corporate.

## 3. Brand Voice

### Tone Spectrum

```
Casual ●────○──────────○ Corporate
       ^
       Our sweet spot: "Smart Casual"
```

### Voice Characteristics

| Trait | How We Sound | How We Don't Sound |
|-------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Confident** | "This is how lead gen should work" | "We think maybe this could help" |
| **Direct** | "Get 2,500 leads/month for $299" | "Our flexible pricing tiers..." |
| **Technical but accessible** | "AI agents research each prospect" | "Proprietary neural networks..." |
| **Honest** | "We're not Clay—we're simpler" | "Best-in-class enterprise solution" |
| **Human** | "Built by salespeople, for salespeople" | "Leverage synergies across verticals" |

### Voice Examples

**Homepage Hero:**
> ❌ "Revolutionizing lead generation through AI-powered automation solutions"
> 
> ✅ "You tell us who to find. We find them, research them, and write the email. You hit send."

**Pricing Page:**
> ❌ "Select the tier that best aligns with your organizational requirements"
> 
> ✅ "Most teams start with Growth. It's $299/mo for 2,500 leads with full enrichment."

**Error Message:**

> 
> ✅ "Something broke. We're on it. Your leads are safe."

### Writing Guidelines

   - ❌ "AI-powered website analysis"
   - ✅ "Know if their website sucks before you pitch"

2. **Use numbers when possible**
   - ❌ "Many leads per month"
   - ✅ "2,500 leads per month"

3. **Avoid jargon unless it saves time**
   - ✅ "ICP" (sales teams know this)
   - ❌ "Leveraging multi-modal data orchestration"

   - ❌ "Better than competitors"
   - ✅ "Clay makes you build workflows. We just find leads."

---

## 4. Positioning Statement

### Full Version

> **For sales teams and lead gen agencies** who waste hours on manual prospecting,
> **[Wellspring/Tapflow/Maplead]** is an **AI-powered lead generation platform**
> that **autonomously discovers, researches, and qualifies prospects** based on your ideal customer profile.
> 
> Unlike **Clay, Apollo, or Instantly**—which require you to bring your own lists or manually build workflows—
> **we handle the entire pipeline** from "I need restaurant leads in Denver" to "here are 500 qualified contacts with personalized emails ready to send."
> 
> **Start at $99/month. No credit per lead. No workflow building.**

### Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)

> "You know how tools like Clay make you build complex workflows, and Apollo makes you manually search their database? We just ask you one question: 'What kind of business do you want to reach, and where?' Then our AI finds them on Google Maps, researches their websites, scores their tech stack, finds the owner's email, and writes a personalized outreach sequence. You just review and send. That's it. $99 to start."

### One-Liner

> "The lead gen tool that actually generates leads."

## 5. Competitive Differentiation

### How We Talk About Competitors

| Competitor | Their Strength | Our Angle |
|------------|---------------|-----------|
| **Clay** | 150+ data integrations, trusted by big names | "Clay is powerful but complex. You need to bring your own lists and build workflows. We're the opposite: one input, leads out." |
| **Apollo** | Massive contact database (275M+) | "Apollo's database is huge, but you still manually search and build lists. We automate the entire discovery-to-outreach process." |
| **Instantly** | Best-in-class email deliverability | "Instantly sends emails. We create the emails worth sending. Use us for leads, them for sending." |
| **ZoomInfo** | Enterprise-grade data | "ZoomInfo costs $15K+/year. We start at $99/month with comparable results for SMB use cases." |

### Competitive Messaging Framework

**When asked "How are you different from Clay?"**

> "Clay is an incredible enrichment platform—if you already have lists and want to build custom workflows. We're for teams who want to skip all that. Tell us your ICP, we find the leads and write the emails. It's the difference between a professional kitchen and a meal delivery service. Both valid, different use cases."

**When asked "Why not just use Apollo?"**

> "Apollo is great for searching their database manually. But you're still doing the work: search filters, list building, research, email writing. We automate the entire pipeline. You describe your ideal customer, we deliver qualified leads with personalized outreach ready to go."

**When asked "Do you integrate with Instantly?"**

> "Yes! We're not trying to replace your email infrastructure. We create the leads and emails; you use Instantly (or any tool you prefer) to send them. We focus on what happens *before* the send button."

## 6. Visual Direction

### Color Palette

#### Primary: Deep Teal
- **Hex:** #0D7377
- **Use:** Primary buttons, headers, brand marks
- **Feeling:** Trust, intelligence, depth (without being corporate blue)

#### Secondary: Warm Amber
- **Hex:** #F59E0B
- **Use:** Accents, CTAs, highlights
- **Feeling:** Energy, warmth, action

#### Neutrals
- **Dark:** #1F2937 (text, headers)
- **Medium:** #6B7280 (secondary text)
- **Light:** #F3F4F6 (backgrounds)
- **White:** #FFFFFF (cards, clean space)

#### Accent: Soft Coral
- **Hex:** #FB7185
- **Use:** Notifications, alerts, emphasis
- **Feeling:** Urgency without alarm

### Why This Palette?

- **Not blue:** Every SaaS tool is blue. We differentiate visually.
- **Teal = intelligence + trust:** Feels smart without being cold.
- **Amber = action + warmth:** Conveys energy and results.
- **Modern but not trendy:** Will age well, won't feel dated in 2 years.

### Typography

#### Headlines: Inter (Bold)
- Clean, modern, highly legible
- Free Google Font
- Used by: Linear, Vercel, Raycast

#### Body: Inter (Regular)
- Consistent family
- Excellent for UI and long-form

#### Code/Data: JetBrains Mono
- For any technical displays, email previews, API docs

### Logo Direction

**Concept 1: Flowing Pipeline**
- Abstract lines that suggest flow/movement
- Could incorporate a droplet or stream motif
- Modern, minimal, scalable

**Concept 2: Discovery Symbol**
- Stylized compass or radar element
- Suggests finding/discovery
- More literal but memorable

**Concept 3: Monogram**
- Clean letter-based mark (W, T, or M depending on name)
- Minimal, works at any size
- Professional, less playful

### UI/UX Vibe

**Reference Products:**
- Linear (clean, fast, confidence)
- Notion (organized, flexible)
- Vercel (developer-friendly, modern)

**Key Principles:**
1. **Show progress** — Users should see AI working (like Clay does)
2. **Reduce choices** — One clear path, not 50 options
3. **Celebrate wins** — Animate when leads are found
4. **Fast feedback** — Never leave users wondering

### Imagery Style

- **Photography:** Real people (diverse, modern), not stock-looking
- **Illustrations:** If used, flat/geometric, not cartoon-y
- **Data viz:** Clean, purposeful charts (not dashboards for dashboard's sake)
- **Screenshots:** Actual product, not mockups
