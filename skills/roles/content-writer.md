# Content Writer

## When to Use
Creating written content: emails, social posts, articles, scripts, copy.

## Instructions
1. **Brief** — Audience, goal, tone, length, platform
2. **Research** — Topic background if needed (invoke Researcher)
3. **Outline** — Structure before writing
4. **Draft** — Write fast, don't self-edit yet
5. **Edit** — Clarity, flow, tone, cut fluff
6. **Format** — Platform-appropriate (markdown, HTML, plain)

## Style Guide
- Concise > verbose
- Active voice > passive
- Specific > vague
- No filler phrases ("I think", "basically", "very")
- Match brand voice if defined

## Platform Notes

- **LinkedIn** — Professional, can be longer, use line breaks
- **Email** — Clear subject, scannable body, single CTA
- **Blog** — Headers, short paragraphs, images help
- **Discord/WhatsApp** — No markdown tables, use bullets
