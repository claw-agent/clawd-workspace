Yeah, I have a friend who basically just set up his own open claw, and he's loving it, but I basically told him that I can send him, like, more or less what we do without any sensitive information, and then he could basically just send it into his open claw and say, like, hey, can you look at these and, like, see what we can, like, we're missing here and, like, what they could utilize from our system.
So I'm just wondering what the best way for us to get that over to him is. He has a telegram so I can forward a file or something, whatever you think, but that'd be super helpful right now.
