okay let's uh jump into this forgive me because it might be a little bit of a ramble and it might
not be super cohesive but i think we'll get through it all great um okay so i'm looking at
the morning intel and i'm seeing the critical security the one click rce exploit published so
we definitely need to investigate that that seems hyper important um and then
yeah maybe you can do some more research on live indices versus rag and compare that to our system
or see if there's anything we can utilize from there and then i looked at the boris
kermies cloud code tips it says turn this thread into your clod.md will you do some research into
that and let me know a little bit more
and if you already have looked into it just let me know if that's something that we should actually
uh try to utilize so yeah i see the action is to find review the original boris
cherny thread um i think there's an image on this perhaps we didn't remember to do the
image review when we're going through these tweets
um oh yeah so the third tweet on the bookmarks the 0x zero i'm really curious to see what you think
about um this model for web scraping i'm not too worried about it because i don't think ours is bad
right now but it's always interesting to me to look at new things um okay so i'm noticing more and
more things on here and this might have been just a problem because we re-ran this report but i'm seeing
like need to expand the link to see full content um we when we have talked about going through twitter
remember that i requested that we go to any external links watch any videos and review all the images to
make sure that we don't have anything especially on smaller batches like a 10 batch review it shouldn't
be too hard to go do that um okay so the noah epstein i see the mission control spreading it says
put this entire article into open claw so maybe we can go through that in more depth as well
i would also like for the sixth tweet to expand the link and review the build while you sleep upgrade
um yeah i'm interested to see what the banker skills are b-a-n-k-r from the seventh tweet
um eight the memory checkpoint protocol um i think that this would be something very interesting for us
oh you said it matches our session state exactly okay just kidding that's great um
um yeah number nine speaker john ash i think that one we talked about using as potential alternative we
should research this technique
uh and then okay you said that's a crypto token promo that's fine so yeah let's just go through
all those one by one i think at least today maybe versus other days it was a little bit more cohesive
as to what we want but then uh in parallel i really want you to make sure that we have all of our tweet
review skills and everything uh proper
you
