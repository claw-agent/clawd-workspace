Yeah, I mean, I'm sure all of these look great.
I'd probably rather see them actually in implementation.
I see that you said the browser's being finicky and you grabbed the,
or you're saying you're going to be the uplash links to grab myself.
One thing here, and this is something I definitely want you to catalog as well,
is that you have a bunch of different access to browser tools.
I don't want to have to do these things manually.
Like if one fails, then I want you to like have a fallback
to like try something else to be able to get them.
And if you still can't, that's fine.
But I'd love for you to take the effort to see if you can fix it yourself.
And then as far as the concept that you are talking about,
I trust your judgment here.
So I would love if you would just do all this stuff
and then actually spin it up into a V2 version of what we had before.
