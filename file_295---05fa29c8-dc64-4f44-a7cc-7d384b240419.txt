Yeah, let's move all the browser automation to spawn sub-agents, and then as far as the trimming the compaction summary, I thought that we had already handled all of that.
I'm just kind of confused what's even happening.
It seems like we are really struggling on something we've already fixed before.
So, I don't know. I don't want to be fixing bandages.
I don't know why we're at 99% right now, and this is probably going to fail anyways.
But, yeah, I mean, I guess earlier today when we had the Chrome automation loop that burned a bunch of the context, I don't know why we didn't just restart the context then and there.
I don't know how we keep getting these upper limits, and we had fixed it.
So, I want to make sure we're fixing symptoms, not just, or fixing the core issues, not just symptoms, because this is a big problem.
And so, maybe look more into this and see what's happening here, because something's not working, and we had it working.
So, maybe look more into this and see what's happening here.
