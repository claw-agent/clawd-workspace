Yeah, let me look through all of this. So what is the difference between morning
briefing and morning report deliver? And then, yeah, I guess one last thing is it
seems like we're running a little bit slower after the update, I guess. I mean,
I'm just noticing that your responses are a bit slower. So like, what could we do to
fix that or kind of get back to where we should be? Otherwise, do you think a lot
of the issues that we've been having are covered with a lot of the new changes
that we made?
