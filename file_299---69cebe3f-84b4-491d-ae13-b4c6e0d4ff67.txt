I think the place where my frustration comes from isn't because like the tools aren't very good.
I'm not even putting blame on you or me or our system.
It's just like I feel like we're missing something because I know it's challenging,
but I'm seeing so many videos all over X of people that are generating some really good masterpieces.
And so I know we say that we don't think the tech is there yet, especially for multi-shot stuff.
Like we've been shown and we've referred to different videos that have been successfully using these tools.
So I'm not really sure what we're missing.
I don't think it's necessarily the tech, though. I do agree the tech will continue to improve.
It's more so just I think something could improve with the way that we're approaching the system,
whether it's from the step-by-step we use, the tooling we use, or whatever it is.
So I think it's a little bit.
