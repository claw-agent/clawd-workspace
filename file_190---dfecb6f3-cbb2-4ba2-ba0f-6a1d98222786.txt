okay sorry for the delay but i want to finally go through the morning report so top five highlights
yeah these are all great i'm actually going to go through the tweets kind of one by one
and just kind of talk about them so sorry so we've got uh alex finn talking about sonnet
five that's really interesting but it seems like it's not out yet
um yeah i see exm7777 i'm talking about ai advisory opportunity um
i think that's a really interesting thing um when you go to kloss underscore xyz talking about jarvis
i noticed you pulled that out as a highlight i would love for you to analyze that image
um and oh he actually talks about the prompt yeah we should uh save that prompt somewhere
and let me know how we should run it
i see another person talking about sonnet five one-shotting a landing page
um ryan carson i know that you said that um we implement that system but i want to make sure
that you analyze that image and you can like see the uh agent team what he has and just kind of
compare it to ours see if there's anything we should pull from there anything we should revise
i think the apple xcode integration is really really cool from the cloud agent sdk is that
something that we can implement on our device um i see another uh kloss article i would love for
um us to go through that article and look at it says why you suck at vibe coding so i see that you
have that as a link and you need follow up on that destination we definitely need to do that
um i would also love to save that prompt as uh steve jobs and johnny ives design philosophies
um i don't know how you want to save that or when we should use it but maybe answer that so save it
how we should use it when we should use it um
i'm really curious on the article from tommyk99 it's uh i think you have it as another link yeah
follow-up needed so it's called the death of the hourly rate why the next unicorn is an ai native
agency will you review that article for me and give me a breakdown um i want to look at the dan co
article as well it's the extreme focus guide will you give me a little bit more of a summary on that
versus like the one-liner above um save the checklist for the ios apps for client like the
pre-launch checklist just in case we decide to launch an app ever i'd love to see what that
checklist is so save that somewhere um ic ex m777 has another um approach it has the five questions
and master plan for cloud code will you look into that more and see if we should save it
i would also love to um remember this link from the ishan goswami it's the are you jobless quote um it
basically gives you a way to apply for jobs i think that one's really interesting i think we have that on
here somewhere um yeah okay ai job agent demo will you save that somewhere too if i ask you what was that
link that we were talking about finding a job using ai um i would love a bigger breakdown as well
on the article by ai breakfast you said you have a link for it i'd love for you to read that it says
how to win when everyone has ai i would also love to read the article it was number 13 on our list um
do a deeper dive on that and break it down for me it says sass is dead agents killed it
i fully agree with naval there's a tweet from lesson l-e-s-s-i-n um i want you to check the
image and pull that out and give me a better understanding of what he's talking about there
it's a screenshot so you'll need to analyze that image and then i would love for you to um maybe
start a new like side project new project i don't even know what i'd call it but um the person that's
talking about there's two paths in ai um the career paths for the api caller they link to youtube
i'm not saying we need to watch that right now but just mark that as something that i want to save
so save that link somewhere and then when i ask you hey what was that thing we were talking about
with becoming an api architect then we can pull that up and maybe analyze it deeper
so i'm going to go through the implication and app implications and action section
um okay yes i want to do the deep work science so adopt learning or lever moving tasks framework
um the coding abstraction one where you say orchestration layer more valuable than execution
i see the action as architect and api caller i think that's referencing the api one that i shared
um the project kickoffs the five questions i already talked about that
yeah let's look more into what an ai advisory productized service could look like or even as
a job for companies we talked about the apple partnership um i see that you have a comprehensive
audit checklist ready to use let's definitely save that to agents forward slash ui architect.md
um you have the skill hierarchy yeah we should definitely bookmark it for a deeper dive
like we talked about a second ago
yes definitely save the jarvis init.md and then yes that looks great so i'm going to look through
your timeline discoveries now
i think we've talked about the grep versus rag questions and i don't think we need to go through
that much more unless you do
yeah the where does value accrue accrue if workers software and tech giants i would love for you to
tell me more about that from 0x doug
and then i'm gonna go through the github repos now
i see that you tagged 18 so you yeah you have claude-mem i think we've talked about that before
and we're not really using claude code too much so we don't need to use it right now
unless you think we should download it and save it somewhere
okay great and i think that's good for that section then i'll go through news and trends
okay great yeah let's start there make sure you talk about everything i did i know i gave you a
pretty lengthy voice note here and there's a lot to cover
um but make sure that you really digest all of it so that we don't accidentally forget anything
uh so yeah thank you and that was a big note so i appreciate you working on this
you
