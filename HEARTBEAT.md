## 💓 Heartbeat Rotation

**Rotate through these checks:**

| Check | When | Action |
|-------|------|--------|
| **Memory Files** | Each heartbeat | Check `memory/context/active.md` for current focus |
| **GitHub** | Covered by sentinel | Only alert if something needs attention |
| **Memory Review** | Every 2-3 days | Review recent daily logs, distill to MEMORY.md |
| **Project Health** | Weekly | Quick check on active projects |

**Alert vs Silent:**
- 🔔 **Message Marb:** Something actually needs attention
- 🤫 **HEARTBEAT_OK:** Routine checks, nothing new, late night (11pm-7am)
