okay let's go through february 13th now so i'm just going to start from the top
let's start on your top five highlights
the harness problem is that something we're already doing number two on the top five highlights
you said it validates our focus on that i just want to make sure that our
work in alignment is there um moving on we've already upgraded to a newer version of open class
so we're good there let's go to the four new bookmarks
oh yeah so the first tweet on the bookmark um hooking up to lists um if you kind of dive through
that tweet and like the quote tweets it's furrowed under or like the ones that is quote tweeted on top
of i'm kind of curious um how we can connect to lists here um it kind of seems like we could
actually utilize some of these lists so maybe you can click through that find where the lists are and
maybe give those a look through and see if there's a a good reason for us to start utilizing those lists
that people attach there that could be a really good way for us to increase our um
um our workflow and like our way to access good ai information or other security information or
what other whatever other info is on that list and maybe improve our um x utilization
um number two it says the link only high engagement post can you just look through that link
and then number four it says it's the tweet about open club build up our builds can lead to garbage
pile up um i think it's a unit a cleanup cron job can you look at this i believe it's a screenshot but
i might be remember misremembering um just kind of want to see if that's something that we should
utilize because that's something that we've talked about before is having a lot of like dead files so to
speak okay yeah so going through your um list right below the bookmarks like the number implication
analysis action section um one that sounds about right two yeah follow up on the link three we've
already upgraded to open claw a newer version okay yeah so this was the elon algorithm approach so prune agent
output sprawl um yeah review if that's sufficient so now we'll go to the timeline discoveries
okay nothing super new there i think we need to go after so i think we're good
um github trending i believe we already have the official google mcp server for chrome dev tools
just i guess verify that but i'm almost positive we are using that
let's look at the second one there the tambo-ai number two on the github trending is generative ui sdk for
react is this something that we should explore more and see if we can utilize in a lot of our design things
um number six it's the clod skills 66 specialized clod code skills still good patterns can you explore
that more and see if there's good patterns that we should steal
um
and then i'm gonna go to the action items really quickly so the first one done
second one we already talked about third we've talked about
um fourth yeah let's review the skills for malicious content
um i think we already do that but let's just give a good check on those to make sure
the explorer tambo generative ui sdk yep we already are going to look into that
um the study paiv 2.5 architecture patterns yeah let's do that and let's do the next one
and then yeah follow up on the monetization link yep so okay you should be good to go make sure you
listen to this whole voice note and let's go through it all
you
