yeah add these patterns into agents and then i guess just give a review over the agents
markdown document to make sure that we don't have anything outdated or old because i want to make
sure that like as we have been spending a good amount of time uh revising our agent strategy
that we don't have any um ways that we're accidentally not calling on the new stuff or
that we're only like partially using it um and yeah i mean this is one of those examples i'm not
sure what your thoughts are like i don't see anything negative by any means in these things
so like you asking me is great to implement i know we have like that skill but like is this something
where you think that i should let you be able to change our agent tick or our agents markdown file
um that's just like a curiosity question i'm really excited though with this new path that we have
because i love the fact that you can iterate and work on your own without just me directing you as a tool
because you're superb
