Yeah, I guess the reason I'm asking all these questions is because one of the companies I'm
working with, Moonwalk, is asking for my GitHub username, but I want to make sure that there's
no way for them to see any of the other projects, like even the names that we've been working on,
because that would get me into some trouble. And so I just want to make sure, and maybe you can
send me like a screenshot of you looking at the username that we use on like a different browser
to make sure there's like nothing that could ever be exposed. And if it's private, like not even
showing the file name or anything like that. And then maybe we can do a check because basically
what they're going to be doing is sending me a repo for us to work on, like edit and stuff.
