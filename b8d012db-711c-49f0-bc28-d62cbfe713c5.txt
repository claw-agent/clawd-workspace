Yeah, I mean, as far as these tools that you talked about above,
I think, let's see.
Yeah, as far as Lucide, Phosphor, and Unsplash,
those all three seem really good.
Is this something that you'd want to use all three of them
for future iterations on projects like this
or requests that are anything similar to this,
or would you rather pick one?
And then as far as the other browser AI tools,
it's kind of up to you.
I mean, I don't think I want to use anything that requires accounts.
I'd rather actually go with the final version.
So if you agree with my questions,
we're like, yeah, we do need a mid-journey type thing
or one of those other ones,
then yeah, that could work if we need it.
But if not, we can try it with the other stuff.
So I'm seeing your next steps.
I think that would be...
Yeah, I'm looking through all of me.
Source Real Assets, yep.
Create the flywheels, proper SVG, not CSS boxes.
Join a logo concept.
Then rebuild the deck.
Yeah, let's definitely do that.
I'm super down.
Thank you.
