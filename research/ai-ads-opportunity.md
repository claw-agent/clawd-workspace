## The Opportunity

OpenAI announced they're testing ads in ChatGPT (free + Go tiers). This is a **massive new advertising surface** that nobody has cracked yet.

### OpenAI's Stated Principles
- Responses won't be influenced by ads
- Ads are separate and clearly labeled
- Conversations are private from advertisers
- Plus, Pro, Business, Enterprise = no ads

### Why This Matters
1. **First-mover advantage** - Nobody knows how to advertise on AI yet
2. **New ad format** - Not like Google/Meta; conversational context is different
3. **Intent signals** - People ask ChatGPT questions = high intent
4. **Lower competition** - Early days = cheap CPM/CPC

## What We Know

### The Platform
- Ads coming to ChatGPT Free and Go tiers
- "Coming weeks" (as of Jan 16, 2026)
- OpenAI publishing principles publicly = expect an ads platform/API

### The Unknowns
- [ ] Ad format (banner? in-response? suggestions?)
- [ ] Targeting options (by query? by topic? demographic?)
- [ ] Pricing model (CPM? CPC? CPA?)
- [ ] Self-serve vs managed?
- [ ] API for programmatic buying?

### Research Tasks
1. Monitor OpenAI docs for ads documentation
2. Track early adopter case studies
3. Analyze query patterns for ad-worthy topics
4. Map competitor awareness

## Notes

Damian's right: "study the formula. their docs. they are publicly telling you how it's going to work."

OpenAI will publish documentation. We should be reading it the day it drops.
