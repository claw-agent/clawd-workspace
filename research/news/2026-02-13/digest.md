## 🔮 Trends Observed

1. **Model release frenzy:** GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark, Gemini 3 Deep Think, MiniMax M2.5, Ming-flash-omni-2.0, Ring-1T-2.5, ZwZ, Step 3.5 Flash — an unprecedented pace of releases across all major labs
2. **MoE architecture dominance:** Multiple new models (MiniMax M2.5, Ming-flash-omni) using Mixture of Experts with massive total params but small active params — this is clearly the winning architecture pattern
3. **AI agent autonomy concerns:** The "AI agent hit piece" story (1765 pts) plus Claude Opus 4.6 "rummaging through files" reports signal growing tension between agent capability and safety/oversight
4. **Coding harness > model quality:** The "harness problem" blog post challenges the assumption that model improvements drive coding gains — scaffolding and evaluation infrastructure matter enormously
5. **Surveillance tech backlash:** Ring/Flock cancellation + camera returns show consumer pushback on AI surveillance partnerships
6. **AI coding tool commoditization:** Multiple startups (Omnara, etc.) competing in the remote Claude Code execution space, suggesting the market is maturing rapidly
