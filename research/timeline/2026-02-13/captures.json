    "text": "My biggest takeaways from @sherwinwu:\n\n1. AI is writing virtually all code at OpenAI. 95% of the engineers use Codex, and engineers who embrace these tools open 70% more pull requests than their peers, and that gap is widening over time.\n\n2. The role of a software engineer is shifting from writing code to managing fleets of AI agents. Many engineers now run 10 to 20 parallel Codex threads, steering and reviewing rather than writing code themselves.\n\n3. The average PR code review time has dropped from 10-15 minutes per PR to 2-3 minutes. Every pull request at OpenAI is now reviewed by Codex before human eyes see it, and Codex surfaces suggestions and catches issues up front. This allows engineers to focus on more creative and strategic work while dramatically increasing productivity.\n\n4. The models will eat your scaffolding for breakfast. When building AI products, don’t optimize for today’s model capabilities. The field is evolving so rapidly that the scaffolding (vector stores, agent frameworks, etc.) that seems essential today may be obsolete tomorrow as models improve.\n\n5. Build for where the models are going, not where they are today. The most successful AI startups build products that work at 80% capability now, knowing the next model release will push them over the line.\n\n6. Top performers become disproportionately more productive with AI tools. AI tools amplify the productivity of high-agency individuals, so the gap between top performers and everyone else is widening. The ROI on unblocking and empowering your best people compounds faster than ever in an AI-augmented environment.\n\n7. Most enterprise AI deployments have negative ROI because they’re top-down mandates without bottom-up adoption. Success requires both executive buy-in and grassroots enthusiasm. Sherwin recommends creating a “tiger team” of technically-minded enthusiasts (often not engineers) who can explore capabilities, apply AI to specific workflows, and create excitement throughout the organization.\n\n8. The one-person billion-dollar startup is coming, but with unexpected second-order effects. As AI makes individuals more productive, we’ll see not just billion-dollar solo founders but an explosion of small businesses: hundreds of $100M startups and tens of thousands of $10M startups. This will transform the startup ecosystem and venture capital landscape.\n\n9. Business process automation is an underrated AI opportunity. While Silicon Valley focuses on knowledge work, most of the economy runs on repeatable business processes with standard operating procedures. There’s massive potential to apply AI to these workflows, which are often overlooked by the tech community.\n\n10. The next two to three years will be the most exciting in tech history. After a relatively quiet period from 2015 to 2020, we’re now in an unprecedented era of innovation. Sherwin encourages everyone to engage with AI tools and not take this moment for granted, as the pace of change will eventually slow.\n\n11. AI models will soon handle multi-hour tasks coherently. Today’s models are optimized for tasks that take minutes, but within 12 to 18 months we’ll see models that can work on complex tasks for upward of six hours. This will enable entirely new categories of products and workflows.\n\n12. Audio is the next frontier for multimodal AI. While coding and text get most of the attention, audio is hugely underrated in business settings. Improvements in speech-to-speech models over the next 6 to 12 months will unlock significant new capabilities for business communication and operations.",

    "text": "The neuroscience here is more radical than people realize.\n\nWhat you’re watching is a hormonal phase transition. Within minutes of skin-to-skin contact with a newborn, a father’s endocrine system starts a cascade that rewires his brain for the next 20 years.\n\nTestosterone drops 34% on average. Gettler’s 2011 landmark study at Notre Dame tracked 624 men and found that the ones who spent 3+ hours per day in direct childcare had the steepest declines. This matters because testosterone and parental sensitivity are inversely correlated. Lower T predicts more responsiveness to infant cues, more physical touch, more synchrony with the child’s emotional states.\n\nMeanwhile, oxytocin surges 33% above non-father baselines. Prolactin spikes. Estradiol rises. These are the same hormones that activate in mothers during pregnancy and breastfeeding. The entire “maternal bonding” cocktail fires in fathers through a different delivery mechanism: proximity and touch.\n\nHere’s where it gets wild. Dr. Pilyoung Kim at the University of Denver scanned fathers’ brains at 2-4 weeks postpartum and again at 12-16 weeks. The regions linked to attachment, empathy, and threat detection showed measurable increases in gray and white matter. The brain physically bulked up in areas responsible for protection and caregiving.\n\nAnd in mice studies, neurogenesis (new neuron formation) occurred in father brains within days of their pups being born. But only in fathers who stayed in the nest. The ones removed on day one showed zero new neuron growth. Physical contact was the switch.\n\nSo the claim about brains being “literally rewired for protection” actually undersells it. The father’s brain grows new tissue. It shifts its entire hormonal architecture from mating optimization to caregiving optimization. The reward circuitry that previously activated for sexual stimuli redirects toward child faces and infant cries.\n\nThe biological mechanism for fatherhood is one of the most aggressive neuroplastic events in the adult male lifespan. And it’s entirely dose-dependent: more contact, more holding, more time in proximity = stronger the neural and hormonal shift.\n\nThat first hold is a pharmacological event.",

What are the use cases that are most valuable for your industry? What are the latest skills that it needs to function at a 10/10 level?\n\nWithout that, you're just going to have a bunch of fancy looking AI agents gathering dust on the shelves because you have no clue how to get any value out of them.\n\nThat's the opportunity...\n\nHere's how you grab it:\n\nPick a valuable industry vertical. Let's say finance.\n\nBuild an agent \"swarm\" that is hyper-specific to that industry use case. So, for finance, it might be around modeling, industry case studies, company analysis, document review, etc.\n\nHire a handful of ex-finance folks (or get them at a high hourly rate in their off-time). Use their industry expertise to train the agents on the initial expertise plus to refine them on an ongoing basis.\n\nYou could niche down even further and choose one specific use case for an initial land grab (i.e. a modeling agent swarm or a loan analysis agent swarm).\n\nDeploy the agents the same way a staffing firm would deploy into a company. You could charge a one-time implementation plus ongoing annual license fee.\n\nContinue to manage and improve the agents using the data and insights coming back from customers. Manage them, keep them up to date, fix any issues.\n\nCustomer is happy because they get the benefits of the transformative tech and cost savings without having to understand the tech or improve it.\n\nYou're happy because you are making money (and doing something pretty cool).\n\nYou could probably replicate this exact playbook across a long list of verticals (hence why I think there are multiple $1B+ opportunities).\n\nJust a thought...",

Treat it like you’d treat a new employee with access to your passwords.\n\nHere’s the prompt I used if you want to run it\n\nPROMPT:\n\n“Analyze your current setup and access permissions. List every tool, API, integration, and account you are connected to.\n\nFor each connection, identify: what data you can read, what actions you can take, and what happens if this connection is compromised by an unauthorized user.\n\nThen rank each connection by risk level (high, medium, low) based on potential damage.\n\nFinally, suggest specific steps to reduce risk for every high and medium item, including access restrictions, time based lockouts, token rotation, and separation of services. \n\nBe thorough.

Elevated cortisol levels can impair memory, decision-making, and problem-solving skills. \n\nOver time, a habit of negativity can make your brain less resilient, affecting emotional regulation and overall cognitive performance. Essentially, the more you complain, the harder it becomes for your brain to handle challenges effectively.\n\nShifting your focus from problems to solutions isn’t just good advice—it’s backed by science. \n\nPractising gratitude, positive thinking, and constructive problem-solving can lower stress hormones, strengthen neural pathways, and help your brain remain agile and adaptable throughout life.\n\n#TheSciencePulse \n#BrainHealth #PositiveMindset",
