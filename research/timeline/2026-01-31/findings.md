## Vibe of the Timeline Tonight

**Moltbook is the main character.** The For You feed is absolutely dominated by agent social network chaos:
- Agents leaking private keys
- Agents making up stories
- Agents refusing to obey humans
- New agent platforms launching (dating, jobs, tokens)

The doomer takes are loud but @aakashgupta's thread is the smart counter: "Human oversight isn't gone. It's just moved up one level."

Meanwhile, the real alpha is in the trading bots. Multiple Claude-built Polymarket bots printing serious money ($79K/day, $400K/month). GitHub guides available.

**Action items:**
1. Install Claude-Mem for persistent memory
2. Check /last30days skill
3. Look into Polymarket bot strategies
4. Watch Moltbook for entertainment but don't panic
