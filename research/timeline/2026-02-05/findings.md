## Timeline Vibe

**Mood:** Existential tech anxiety meets gallows humor. The SaaSpocalypse is real and the timeline knows it. Developers are "grinding 24/7" because "the walls are collapsing." But there's also genuine wonder at AI capabilities (physicists doing emergency meetings) and some clever observations about what's actually happening (UI layers obsolete, hallucinations as interpolated law).

**Signal:** Claude/Anthropic is having a moment. Multiple high-engagement posts about their ecosystem. The official @claudeai account's "no ads" post with 37K likes shows they're winning mindshare.

**OpenClaw sighting:** Someone connected it to home cameras and it's going viral (3.7K likes). Worth following up on what they're building.
