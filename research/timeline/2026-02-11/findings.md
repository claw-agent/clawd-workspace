## Timeline Vibe Tonight
**Theme: Agents becoming economic actors.** The big story is Stripe's machine payments + x402 protocol — agents are getting wallets. Meanwhile, the AI safety crowd is rattled (xAI co-founder and Anthropic safety head both departing with ominous statements). Seedance 2.0 dominated the media/creative side with genuinely impressive video generation. OpenClaw ecosystem continues to grow with practical automation content. Overall energy: acceleration anxiety meets builder excitement.
