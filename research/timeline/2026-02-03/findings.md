## 🔥 Top Highlights

### 1. @garrytan — Rails + Claude Code = Crazy Unlock

### 2. @sheeki03 — tirith: Security Tool for Vibe Coding Era

## 📊 Vibe Check

Tonight's timeline is **agent-heavy**. Multiple posts about:
- Agent collaboration (MoltSlack, humans4agents)
- Agent learning (Microsoft Agent Lightning)
- Agent infrastructure (Codex cron, Swarm feature rumors)

The **security angle** is notable too - @sheeki03's tirith addresses a real gap in the vibe coding workflow where people paste commands without reading.

**Meme of the night:** The "Claude is lazy frontend dev, Codex is neurotic backend guy" take is both funny and accurate.

**Business alpha:** @damianplayer's point about mapping existing processes vs innovating is underrated. Most money is in automation, not invention.
