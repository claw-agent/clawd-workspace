## Timeline Vibe
Dominated by **steipete joining OpenAI** — biggest story of the day. Heavy OpenClaw ecosystem activity (Kimi Claw, new release, Discord components). Kimi model making waves as cheap near-Opus alternative. NVIDIA commoditizing voice AI. Strong "agents for SMBs" signal with Cuban clip and local SEO thread. Overall: the agent ecosystem is maturing fast and the SMB opportunity window is wide open.
