## General Vibe

**This week hit different.** Opus 4.6 dropped and the timeline is processing it in real-time:

- Engineers are having actual mental health crises
- Business people see the opportunity window opening
- AI capability jumps are now too fast for comfortable adjustment
- "Fast takeoff" isn't theory anymore — it's the lived experience

**Market mood:** Maximum uncertainty. Nobody knows what's coming next, but everyone agrees it's coming fast.

**Opportunity signal:** AI concierge/setup services market is validated at premium prices. Sahil Bloom saying he'd pay $5k for someone to build him an AI assistant. SetupClaw guy 10x'd prices and revenue went up.

**Doomer signal:** Tom Dale's observation about engineer mental health crisis is the most important cultural indicator of the night.
