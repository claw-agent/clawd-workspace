## The Tweet
> Introducing the Firecrawl Skill + CLI for Agents 🔥
>
> Agents like Claude Code, Codex, and OpenCode need live quality context from the web.

## Summary
Firecrawl releases an official CLI tool for AI agents that efficiently scrapes web content to local files with built-in search capabilities. Designed for token efficiency.

## Why This Matters
We already use Firecrawl (npm installed) but don't have the CLI skill. This could improve our web research workflow by:
- Better integration with agent workflows
- Local file storage for reuse
- Bash-powered search across scraped content

## Action Items
- [ ] Run `npx skills add firecrawl/cli` to install
- [ ] Test integration with our research workflows
- [ ] Update TOOLS.md with Firecrawl CLI usage
