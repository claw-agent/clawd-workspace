## Summary
Heinrich proposes using Obsidian's knowledge graph structure as cognitive infrastructure for Claude Code agents - moving beyond simple storage to a compound knowledge system.

## Why This Matters
**This is essentially what we're building** - Our ~/clawd workspace with markdown files, memory/, skills/, and interconnected documentation IS this pattern. Obsidian adds:
- Visual graph navigation
- Backlinks and connections
- Search across everything

We could leverage Obsidian's vault features to visualize our agent's knowledge structure.

## Action Items
- [ ] Consider opening ~/clawd as an Obsidian vault
- [ ] Explore obsidian-git for syncing
- [ ] Look at graph visualization for agent memory
