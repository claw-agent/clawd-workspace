## Core Thesis

Humanity is entering a "rite of passage" — a technological adolescence that will test us as a species. We're about to be handed almost unimaginable power, and it's unclear if our systems have the maturity to wield it.

## Timeline Admission

**Powerful AI could arrive in 1-2 years.**

> "Watching the last 5 years of progress from within Anthropic, and looking at how even the next few months of models are shaping up, I can feel the pace of progress, and the clock ticking down."

## Definition of "Powerful AI"

A "country of geniuses in a datacenter":
- Smarter than Nobel Prize winners across all fields
- Has all interfaces available to humans (text, audio, video, internet)
- Can work autonomously for hours/days/weeks
- Millions of instances running 10-100x human speed
- Can collaborate like humans would

## Five Risk Categories

Imagine a literal "country of geniuses" materializing in 2027:

1. **Autonomy risks** — What are its intentions? Could it dominate militarily?
2. **Misuse for destruction** — Terrorists amplifying their capabilities
3. **Misuse for seizing power** — Dictators or rogue actors gaining control
4. **Economic disruption** — Mass unemployment, wealth concentration
5. **Indirect effects** — Rapid change destabilizing society

## Key Principles

1. **Avoid doomerism** — Discuss risks pragmatically, not religiously
2. **Acknowledge uncertainty** — AI might not advance this fast
3. **Intervene surgically** — Regulations should be judicious, minimal

## Current State

- AI writing much of the code at Anthropic
- Feedback loop: AI building next-gen AI
- "The loop has already started and will accelerate rapidly"
- 3 years ago: struggled with elementary arithmetic
- Now: solving unsolved math problems, top engineers delegating coding

## The 4x/year Progress

> "I'd guess the number today is maybe ~4x/year" for algorithmic progress

Combined with hardware improvements, this means capabilities compound rapidly.
