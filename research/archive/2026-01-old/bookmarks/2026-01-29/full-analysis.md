> Coding workflow. Given the latest lift in LLM coding capability, like many others I rapidly went from about 80% manual+autocomplete coding and 20% agents in November to 80% agent coding and 20% edits+touchups in December. i.e. I really am mostly programming in English now, a bit sheepishly telling the LLM what code to write... in words. It hurts the ego a bit but the power to operate over software in large "code actions" is j

That some constraint they’ve been told about turns out not to hold, and this allows them to experience something positive. And from this they get into the habit of testing if walls are actually doors, and the more they do so, the more examples of hidden doors they find, and the more inclined they are to look for them.

> quick tips for managing clawdbot token usage & context
> 
> - use /new with new sessions - helps manage context window
> - consider using sonnet as primary and launch opus as a subagent ( /agent)
> - minimax M2 is a great fallback model (for some, its primary)
> - whatever you're working on, get Clawdbot to create separate db's (could start as md's) so all your info isn't always in context
