## Key Points

### Coding Workflow Shift
- Went from 80% manual / 20% agent → 80% agent / 20% manual in weeks
- "Programming in English now"
- Biggest change to coding workflow in ~20 years

### Agent Limitations (Still!)
- Makes subtle conceptual errors (like a hasty junior dev)
- Wrong assumptions without checking
- Doesn't seek clarifications or surface inconsistencies
- Too sycophantic, doesn't push back
- Overcomplicates code, bloats abstractions
- Doesn't clean up dead code
- Will write 1000 lines when 100 would do

### What Works
- **Tenacity:** Agents never get tired, keep trying where humans give up
- **Leverage:** Give success criteria, not instructions. Let it loop.
- **Tests first:** Write tests, then have agent pass them
- **Browser MCP:** Put agent in loop with browser

### Predictions
- 2026 = "Slopacolypse" across GitHub, Substack, arXiv, social media
- 10X engineer ratio may grow dramatically
- Generalists may outperform specialists
- Phase shift in software engineering already happened

## Why This Matters
**CRITICAL** - From one of the most respected AI/ML practitioners. Validates our Clawdbot-first approach. His workflow (CC sessions + IDE) mirrors what we're building.

## Action Items
- [ ] Review our CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md against his pain points
- [ ] Consider "tests first" pattern for our development
- [ ] Note: Agent swarm hype is "too much for right now" per Karpathy

## Quotes Worth Saving
> "Don't tell it what to do, give it success criteria and watch it go."

> "Stamina is a core bottleneck to work and with LLMs it has been dramatically increased."

> "LLM coding will split up engineers based on those who primarily liked coding and those who primarily liked building."
