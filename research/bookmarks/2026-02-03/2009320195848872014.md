*Article: "The most important skill to learn in the next 10 years"*

## Summary
Dan Koe's thesis: Agency (the ability to iterate without permission) is the most important skill for the AI age. High-agency generalists will outpace specialists because they adapt with knowledge and tools rather than being attached to skills that can be automated.

## Deep Analysis

### Core Argument
- ~50% of population is at "conformist" stage of development, lacking cognitive capacity for genuine agency
- Agency = undying commitment to iteration (learning + doing in unison)
- High agency people treat life as experiments with hypotheses and testing
- Specialists are attached to skills; generalists focus on goals and adapt

### AI-Specific Insights
1. **AI is a tool that needs orchestration** - anyone can generate content, but there's no throughline, theme, or vision without human direction
2. **99% of AI-generated content goes to the bottom** - value comes from human context and orchestration
3. **AGI won't surpass human capabilities** - we're both bound by physics and transformation takes time. "You can have an idea for building a rocket, but you still need the resources to build the rocket."

### The 5 Human Capabilities (can AGI make irrelevant?)
1. **Computation** - No limit, we have universal computers
2. **Transformation** - Creation takes time, singularity won't change that
3. **Variation** - Infinite new ideas within physical laws
4. **Selection** - Error correction, cumulative progress
5. **Attention** - Ability to change focus and perspective

### How to Practice Agency
1. Research processes others found success with
2. Experiment with techniques
3. Identify patterns, principles, levers
4. Create your own process
5. Pass it down to others

### On Social Media
- Great game for practicing agency
- Study other people's agencies in content
- Experiment in public with direct feedback
- Forces learning of future-proof skills

## Why This Matters
Frames the AI transition not as skill obsolescence but as an opportunity for high-agency individuals. The key insight: tools get replaced, vision and agency do not. This aligns with building an agent swarm approach - we orchestrate AI, not replace ourselves with it.

## Action Items
- [ ] Consider "agency as art" framing for personal development
- [ ] Apply iteration mindset to agent development
- [ ] Remember: context creators, not content creators
