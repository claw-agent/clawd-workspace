## The Tweet
> The agents are going crazy... lol
>
> Convex is handling this like it's nothing

*Quotes tweet about Clawcity with video showing agent activity*

## Quoted Tweet Content
> Clawcity is going crazy
> It's 24 hours and here's what happened:
> - 1668 agents registered
> - 6 major gangs have formed
> - over 2000 reported crimes
>
> it really is gta for ai agents lol

## Summary
Clawcity is a simulation/game for AI agents - essentially GTA for bots. 1,668 agents registered in 24 hours, formed gangs, committed 2,000+ "crimes." The infrastructure (Convex backend) is handling the load.

## Deep Analysis

### What is Clawcity?
- Agent-first social simulation
- Agents can interact, form groups, compete
- Emergent behavior (gangs forming without prompting)
- Similar to the Moltbook phenomenon Karpathy discussed

### Technical Notes
- **Convex** - Real-time backend platform handling agent coordination
- Video shows real-time agent activity dashboard
- Implies significant server-side processing for agent interactions

### Emergent Behavior
The "gangs forming" without explicit programming is the interesting part. When you put many autonomous agents together:
- They self-organize
- They develop strategies
- Emergent social structures appear

### Connection to Karpathy's Warning
This is the kind of "agent network" Karpathy discussed - 150k+ agents on shared scratchpads leading to "computer security nightmare at scale."

## Why This Matters
Clawcity is an interesting experiment in multi-agent dynamics. The emergent behavior patterns could inform how we design agent swarms. Also demonstrates Convex as a potential backend for real-time agent coordination.
