## The Tweet
> Every vibe coder should understand this 👇
>
> The basics (non-negotiable):
> - .env → what lives there & what NEVER gets pushed
> - npm run dev = local only
> - package.json = scripts, deps, versions
> - npm run build = what actually ships
> - npm packages (install / remove / update)
> - git add .env ❌ (instant regret)
> - localhost:3000 ≠ a real URL
> - env vars ≠ hardcoded values
> - terminal errors matter (don't ignore them)
>
> Nice-to-have (saves days):
> - npm i --legacy-peer-deps (when deps fight)
> - .gitignore (what never gets tracked)
> - basic git (clone, pull, commit, push)
> - DB schemas / SQL (if data exists)
> - auth basics (users, sessions, tokens)
> - common dev words (components, modals, cards…)
> - reading docs > guessing
> - asking AI better questions
>
> You don't need to be a "real dev."
> You just need enough to ship.

## Summary
Essential knowledge checklist for "vibe coders" (AI-assisted developers who may lack traditional coding background). Distinguishes between non-negotiable basics and nice-to-have knowledge.

## Deep Analysis

### The "Vibe Coder" Phenomenon
- People using AI to code without traditional programming education
- Can build things but may lack foundational knowledge
- Common pitfall: shipping .env files with secrets

### Key Takeaways
1. **Security basics** - .env never in git, env vars for secrets
2. **Dev vs prod** - localhost isn't production
3. **Error handling** - Terminal errors aren't decoration
4. **Dependency management** - Understanding npm basics
5. **Auth fundamentals** - Sessions, tokens, users

### Why This Matters
As AI lowers the barrier to coding, more people build without understanding fundamentals. This creates security risks and maintenance nightmares. This checklist is good for anyone supervising AI-generated code.
