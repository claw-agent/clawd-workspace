## Summary
Claude-Mem is an open-source plugin enabling persistent memory for Claude Code sessions, dramatically reducing token usage and extending effective context.

## Deep Analysis

### Key Claims
- **95% fewer tokens per session** - By persisting memory externally, the agent doesn't need to re-explain context each session
- **20x more tool calls** - With less token overhead, more of the context window is available for actual work
- **Open source** - Can inspect, modify, and self-host

### How It Likely Works
1. Captures important context/decisions during sessions
2. Stores them in external persistent storage (likely local files or DB)
3. Retrieves relevant memories on session start
4. Injects summarized context rather than raw chat history

### Similar Tools
- QMD (already installed) - local search/indexing
- Supermemory plugin
- Our own MEMORY.md + SESSION-STATE.md system

## Why This Matters
Token efficiency is a major constraint for long-running agents. If Claude-Mem can deliver on these claims, it's worth investigating for heavy Claude Code users.

## Action Items
- [ ] Find Claude-Mem GitHub repo
- [ ] Compare to our existing memory system
- [ ] Evaluate if it complements or replaces QMD/memory files
