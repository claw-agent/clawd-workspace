## Summary
Meta-tip suggesting users extract Boris Cherny's Claude Code tips thread and convert them into CLAUDE.md instructions. The quoted thread is from Boris Cherny, creator of Claude Code, sharing 10 official tips from the team.

## Deep Analysis

### Boris Cherny's 10 Claude Code Tips (Quoted Thread):

1. **Do more in parallel** - Run 3-5 git worktrees with separate Claude sessions. Use shell aliases (za, zb, zc) to hop between them. This is the #1 productivity unlock from the team.

2. **Start complex tasks in plan mode** - Pour energy into the plan so Claude can 1-shot implementation. When things go sideways, switch back to plan mode. Use a second Claude as "staff engineer" to review plans.

3. **Invest in your CLAUDE.md** - After every correction: "Update your CLAUDE.md so you don't make that mistake again." Claude is eerily good at writing rules for itself. Keep iterating until mistake rate drops.

4. **Create and commit your own skills** - If you do something more than once a day, make it a skill or command. Examples:
   - /techdebt slash command for end of session
   - Sync 7 days of Slack/GDrive/Asana/GitHub into one context dump
   - Analytics agents that write dbt models and review code

5. **Claude fixes most bugs itself** - Enable Slack MCP, paste bug thread, say "fix." Or just say "Go fix the failing CI tests." Point at docker logs for distributed systems debugging.

6. **Level up prompting**:
   - Challenge Claude: "Grill me on these changes"
   - After mediocre fix: "Knowing everything you know now, scrap this and implement the elegant solution"
   - Write detailed specs to reduce ambiguity

7. **Terminal & Environment Setup**:
   - Team loves Ghostty (sync rendering, 24-bit color, unicode)
   - Use /statusline to show context usage and git branch
   - Use voice dictation (fn x2 on macOS) - 3x faster than typing

8. **Use subagents**:
   - Append "use subagents" to throw more compute at problems
   - Offload tasks to keep main agent's context clean
   - Route permission requests to Opus 4.5 via hook

9. **Use Claude for data & analytics** - Use bq CLI to pull metrics. Haven't written SQL in 6+ months. Works with any DB with CLI/MCP/API.

10. **Learning with Claude**:
    - Enable "Explanatory" or "Learning" output style
    - Generate visual HTML presentations for unfamiliar code
    - Ask for ASCII diagrams
    - Build spaced-repetition learning skill

### Community Additions:
- Chrome MCP validation for web changes
- Auto-evaluate sessions with score criteria
- Split CLAUDE.md into workflow rules + personality/style
- /permissions to pre-allow permissions

## Why This Matters
Direct tips from Claude Code's creator. This is primary source information on how to maximize Claude Code productivity. The "Claude writes rules for itself" pattern is particularly powerful for self-improving setups.

## Action Items
- [x] Already implemented CLAUDE.md self-improvement pattern in AGENTS.md
- [ ] Consider git worktrees setup for parallel sessions
- [ ] Try voice dictation for longer prompts (fn x2)
- [ ] Add /statusline customization
- [ ] Explore Chrome MCP for web validation
