> your moltbot memory is broken and you probably don't realize it.
> a bigger context window isn't the fix but checkpoints are.
>
> CHECKPOINT LOOP (every 30 min or on trigger)
> 1. context getting full? → flush summary to memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md
> 2. learned something permanent? → write to MEMORY.md
> 3. new capability or workflow? → save to skills/
> 4. before restart? → dump anything important

**Quick take:** Checkpoint loop for agent memory - exactly what we already have in AGENTS.md. Validates our approach.

> I don't use RAG at all
> I use live generated indices

**Quick take:** Claims live-generated indices outperform RAG for long documents. Interesting alternative to our QMD setup. Worth investigating.

> .ai4 domains... TLD namespace... mint agent's name...

**Quick take:** Crypto domain sales pitch masquerading as agent infrastructure. Zero engagement confirms low value. Skip.
