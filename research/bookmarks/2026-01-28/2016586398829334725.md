## Summary
Corbin argues Moltbot (Clawdbot equivalent) is transformative ONLY for engineers - the "biggest unlock since ChatGPT 3.5" that could drive software costs to zero. Non-developers won't benefit.

## Why This Matters
Aligns with Karpathy's observations:
- LLM coding is a phase shift for developers
- Non-technical users need different tools
- "Software going to 0" = commoditization of development

Validates Marb's investment in learning these tools.
