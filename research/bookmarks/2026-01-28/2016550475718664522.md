## The Tweet
> CRITICAL: EVERYONE USING CLAWDBOT SHOULD RUN THIS PROMPT RIGHT NOW:
>
> By default, the 2 best Clawd memory features are turned OFF
>
> Running this 1 prompt will immediately stop your AI from getting confused in between compactions/sessions:
>
> Prompt:
>
> "Enable memory flush before compaction and session memory search in my Clawdbot config. Set `compaction.memoryFlush.enabled` to true and set `memorySearch.experimental.sessionMemory` to true with sources including both memory and sessions. Apply the config changes."
>
> Here's what you enabled by running that prompt:
>
> Memory Flush: Your AI automatically saves everything important to a file right before its context gets wiped, so nothing slips through the cracks.
>
> Session memory search: Your AI can search through every conversation it's ever had with you, even ones it no longer "remembers."
>
> Boom, your ClawdBot memory is now 10000x better

## Summary
Alex Finn shares two critical Clawdbot config settings that improve memory persistence: memory flush before compaction (auto-saves before context wipe) and session memory search (enables searching past conversations).

## Why This Matters
**CRITICAL FOR US** - These are config settings we should verify are enabled on Marb's Clawdbot. Memory flush prevents losing context during compactions. Session memory search lets us access historical conversations.

## Action Items
- [ ] **CHECK IMMEDIATELY:** Verify both settings are enabled in our config
- [ ] Test memory_search with session memory if not already working
- [ ] Document these settings in TOOLS.md
