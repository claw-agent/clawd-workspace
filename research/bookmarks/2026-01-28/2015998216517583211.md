## The Tweet
> I let Claude Code turn @karpathy's post into agent skills. It first generated a bunch of skill files and around 800 lines of descriptions.
>
> Then I let it use these agent skills to review itself. Boom, it cut itself down to 70 lines of clean, solid instructions.

## Summary
JY Zhang used Claude Code to convert Karpathy's viral LLM coding post into agent skills, then had Claude self-optimize from 800 → 70 lines.

## Deep Analysis
Referenced Karpathy post highlights:
- 80% agent coding by Dec 2025
- Models make conceptual errors, not syntax
- Don't tell it what to do, give success criteria
- Tenacity = agents work where humans give up
- 2026 = "slopacolypse" year

## Why This Matters
**HIGH VALUE** - Meta-prompting pattern: use Claude to distill expertise into skills, then self-review.
