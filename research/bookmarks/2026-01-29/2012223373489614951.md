## The Tweet
> In the coming weeks, we plan to start testing ads in ChatGPT free and Go tiers.

We’re sharing our principles early on how we’ll approach ads–guided by putting user trust and transparency first as we work to make AI accessible to everyone.

What matters most:
- Responses in ChatGPT will not be influenced by ads.

- Ads are always separate and clearly labeled.

- Your conversations are private from advertisers.

- Plus, Pro, Business, and Enterprise tiers will not have ads.
