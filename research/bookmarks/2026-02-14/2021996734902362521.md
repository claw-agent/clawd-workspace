## The Tweet
> Today we're launching a revamped Brave Search API, designed to make web search dramatically more useful for AI applications. Our testing shows that it's the most powerful search API to date and beats ChatGPT, Google AI Mode, and Perplexity in testing...

## Summary
Official Brave announcement of their revamped Search API with LLM Context endpoint. Claims to beat ChatGPT, Google AI Mode, and Perplexity in AI search quality benchmarks. Massive engagement (3.2K likes) signals strong developer interest.

## Deep Analysis
This is the source announcement that @Legendaryy's article (2022270816679772598) analyzes in depth. The tweet itself is brief — it's the linked blog post that contains the technical details. Key claims from the announcement:
- Independent 35B+ page search index
- LLM Context API extracts smart chunks optimized for token efficiency
- Under 600ms p90 latency for full pipeline
- Beats frontier AI search products in 1,500-query evaluation
- $5/1K requests, simple pricing
- SOC 2 Type II, Zero Data Retention
- Open-sourced skills for Claude Code, Cursor, OpenClaw

The 3.2K likes and 194 RTs indicate this resonated strongly with the AI developer community.

## Why This Matters
We already have Brave Search MCP integrated in OpenClaw. This upgrade makes it significantly more powerful for agent web grounding. The LLM Context endpoint is exactly what we need — pre-extracted, token-efficient context chunks rather than raw HTML.

## Action Items
- [ ] Test new Brave LLM Context API endpoint
- [ ] Check if OpenClaw's Brave MCP server already supports the new endpoint
