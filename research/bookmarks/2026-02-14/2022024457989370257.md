> Seedance 2.0 Mastery: The Complete 2026 Guide to Pro AI Video Creation

## Summary
Exhaustive guide to ByteDance's Seedance 2.0 video generation model — access methods, capabilities, limitations, prompting strategies, and 10 mega-prompts for commercial video creatives (luxury watches, fitness, coffee, tech, skincare, travel, food, fashion, eco, automotive).

## Deep Analysis
**What Seedance 2.0 is:** ByteDance's multimodal video gen model. Key differentiators: temporal stability, character consistency across shots, native audio generation, director controls (camera, lighting, motion intensity). Outputs 5-10 second clips up to 1080p.

**Access paths (Feb 2026):**
- Dreamina via CapCut (dreamina.capcut.com) — clearest international path
- Jimeng (jimeng.jianying.com) — China-facing, requires +86 phone / 69 RMB subscription
- Third-party wrappers — treat with skepticism

**Key limitations:**
- Realistic human face uploads blocked for compliance
- 5-10 second max clip length
- Specs vary by platform/tier
- Rapidly evolving

**Prompt structure that works:** Scene environment → camera behavior → lighting quality → motion physics → audio direction → emotional target

The 10 mega-prompts are extremely detailed (1000+ words each) covering specific commercial verticals. They demonstrate the @reference tagging system for inputs.

## Why This Matters
Directly relevant to Marb's Red Rising AI video project. We've already been struggling with Seedance 2.0 access (ChatCut issues documented in active.md). This guide provides the definitive access path (Dreamina via CapCut) and comprehensive prompting framework. The mega-prompts are overly verbose but the structure is instructive.

## Action Items
- [ ] Share Dreamina access path with Marb (dreamina.capcut.com)
- [ ] Extract prompt structure template for Red Rising project
- [ ] Note: our ChatCut struggles align with "third-party wrapper" warnings in the article
