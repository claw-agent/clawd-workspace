## The Tweet
> Your Agent Is Only as Good as Its Search

## Summary
Comprehensive comparison of 5 AI search APIs (Brave LLM Context, Tavily, Exa, Perplexity Sonar, Firecrawl) triggered by Brave's new LLM Context API launch. Argues search quality now matters more than model choice as LLMs commoditize.

## Deep Analysis
This is a high-quality, deeply researched breakdown of the AI search API landscape as of Feb 2026:

**Key findings:**
- Brave's LLM Context API: Independent 35B-page index, smart chunk extraction, <600ms latency, $5/1K requests, SOC 2 + ZDR. Open-sourced skills for Claude Code and OpenClaw.
- Tavily: Default in LangChain/LlamaIndex ecosystem (800K+ devs), credit-based pricing, agent skills + /research endpoint.
- Exa: Neural embedding search (meaning-based), Exa Instant at sub-200ms, trained on 144x H200 cluster.
- Perplexity Sonar: Bundled search+LLM answers with citations. Trade-off: no control over model layer.
- Firecrawl: Extraction specialist, not a search engine. Open source, self-hostable, flat $1/page pricing.

**The big insight:** Brave showed a weaker open-weight model (Qwen3) with high-quality search context outperformed ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google AI Mode. Context quality > model capability.

**Recommended stack:** Brave for grounding + Exa for discovery + Firecrawl for extraction + Perplexity for quick answers. Route by query type. $50-100/month covers comprehensive agent search.

## Why This Matters
Directly relevant to our agent infrastructure. We already use Firecrawl (SDK installed, no API key). Brave Search MCP is integrated in OpenClaw. This article validates a multi-API routing approach and provides the specific decision framework for which API to use when. The Brave LLM Context API looks like the strongest general-purpose option for our agent stack.

## Action Items
- [ ] Evaluate Brave LLM Context API for agent web grounding (replaces basic web_fetch?)
- [ ] Consider Exa for semantic research discovery tasks
- [ ] Set up Firecrawl API key (SDK already installed)
- [ ] Build search routing layer: factual→Brave, semantic→Exa, extraction→Firecrawl
