## Summary
New open-source TTS app "Voicebox" launches, powered by Qwen3-TTS with near-perfect voice cloning, DAW-style editor, fully local execution. Positioned as ElevenLabs killer.

## Deep Analysis
This is directly relevant to our TTS stack. Currently using claw-speak (Kokoro-based) and edge-tts as fallback. Voicebox with Qwen3-TTS could be a significant upgrade:
- **Near-perfect voice cloning** — could create better custom voices
- **DAW-like Stories Editor** — useful for longer audio content (morning briefs, podcasts)
- **Fully local** — aligns with our privacy-first approach
- **Open source** — can be integrated into our pipeline

The Qwen3-TTS model was already noted as impressive in earlier bookmarks (Qwen TTS dropping). This is a polished GUI wrapper.

## Why This Matters
Could replace or supplement our current TTS pipeline. The Stories Editor feature is particularly interesting for creating polished morning brief audio. Voice cloning could create a more natural "Claw voice."

## Action Items
- [ ] Find Voicebox repo and evaluate
- [ ] Test Qwen3-TTS voice quality vs Kokoro
- [ ] Consider for morning brief voice upgrade
