## Summary
Follow-up to the memory protocol tweet — @thejayden proposes a ZERO_ERROR_PROTOCOL.md file that forces agents to verify their work, label uncertainty, and never guess. Claims it reduces hallucination and credit costs.

## Deep Analysis
The concept of a verification protocol is sound. Our system already has some guardrails (safety rules in AGENTS.md), but a dedicated anti-hallucination protocol could help with:
- Research accuracy (morning reports)
- Financial analysis tasks
- Any task where fabricated data is costly

The specific techniques (re-derive math, label uncertainty, never guess missing data) are good prompt engineering patterns. The "raise internal confidence threshold" is interesting — essentially telling the agent to be more conservative.

## Why This Matters
Could improve our agent reliability, especially for research tasks. Worth evaluating if a dedicated verification protocol reduces errors in our pipeline.
