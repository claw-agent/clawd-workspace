## Summary
@thejayden shares a memory protocol for OpenClaw agents that implements daily logs, structured long-term memory, and documented decisions — turning agents from stateless to compounding systems.

## Deep Analysis
This is essentially what Marb already has built (AGENTS.md, active.md, daily notes, MEMORY.md). The image likely contains a specific implementation pattern. The high engagement (1.1K likes) shows this is a pain point many OpenClaw users face. Worth checking if their specific implementation has any patterns we haven't adopted — particularly around:
- Decision documentation format
- Memory compounding mechanics
- Any novel checkpoint triggers

Our system is already more sophisticated (WAL protocol, tiered memory, QMD indexing), but there may be useful refinements.

## Why This Matters
Validates Marb's existing memory architecture. Could contain specific patterns worth adopting. The OpenClaw community is actively solving the same problems we've already solved — potential to contribute or learn.
