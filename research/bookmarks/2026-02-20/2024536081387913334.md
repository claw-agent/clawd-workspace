## Summary
Open-source tool that uses 8 parallel web agents to auto-generate skill guides by scraping documentation, GitHub, Stack Overflow, and blogs. Essentially auto-creates agent skills from any topic.

## Deep Analysis
This is a meta-tool: agents that create skills for other agents. The parallel scraping approach is clever — similar to our scout swarm pattern but for knowledge acquisition. Could be useful for:
- Auto-generating skill files for new tools we adopt
- Research acceleration (parallel source scraping)
- Creating training materials for XPERIENCE workflows

@dr_cintas (Alvaro Cintas) consistently shares high-quality AI tooling content. This follows his Claude-Mem and Ollama Launch posts.

## Why This Matters
Could accelerate our skill creation pipeline. Instead of manually writing skill files, point this at a topic and get a draft. Particularly useful for rapidly onboarding new tools.

## Action Items
- [ ] Find the repo (likely linked in thread)
- [ ] Test skill generation for a tool we're evaluating
