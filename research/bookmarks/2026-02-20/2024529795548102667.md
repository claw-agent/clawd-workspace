## Summary
Google Labs launches "Photoshoot" feature in Pomelli — an AI product photography tool that generates professional marketing shots from a single product image. Free in US, CA, AU, NZ.

## Deep Analysis
This is a massive play by Google into AI-generated product photography. The engagement (26K likes) shows enormous market demand. Key implications:
- **Eliminates product photography costs** for small businesses and e-commerce sellers
- **Free tier** in major English-speaking markets signals Google wants market share over revenue initially
- Directly competes with services like Photoroom, Flair.ai, and traditional product photography studios
- Video demo format suggests polished, production-ready tool (not a research preview)

## Why This Matters
Directly relevant to XPERIENCE and any business doing marketing. AI product photography at zero cost removes a major friction point for small business marketing. Could be integrated into Marb's client workflows.
