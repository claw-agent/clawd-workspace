## The Tweet
> Strongly recommend explicitly telling Claude Code to only use Sonnet or Opus for sub agents
> Explore Agent defaults to Haiku, and Task Agent is specified by parent
> For large, complex repos, this means high potential of missing key logic

## Summary
Practical tip: Claude Code's Explore Agent defaults to Haiku for sub-agents, which can miss important logic in complex repos. Fix by explicitly specifying Sonnet or Opus for sub-agents in your instructions.

## Why This Matters
Directly actionable for our setup. We spawn sub-agents frequently and should ensure they're using capable models for complex tasks. This is a subtle gotcha that could explain quality issues in delegated work.

## Action Items
- [ ] Review our AGENTS.md sub-agent spawning to ensure model specification
- [ ] Test if our current setup inherits the right model for sub-agents
