## Summary
Massive life automation prompt — a structured 9-domain audit system (career, side hustle, finances, health, productivity, relationships, home, learning, info management) that generates a complete automation map and step-by-step implementation guide using AI tools.

## Deep Analysis
This is a comprehensive 3-phase system:
1. **Questionnaire Phase** — Systematic audit across 9 life domains with 3-5 questions per round
2. **Automation Map** — Scored recommendations (time saved, difficulty, cost, impact) organized by domain with Top 10 Quick Wins
3. **Implementation Guide** — Step-by-step setup for each automation with tool recommendations, setup time, and maintenance estimates

The prompt is extremely well-structured with role definition, tone guidelines, few-shot examples, and output formatting specs. It covers AI tool categories including LLMs, no-code automation (Zapier/Make/n8n), AI scheduling, email tools, finance tools, and custom agent workflows.

## Why This Matters
This is a ready-to-use consulting framework. Could be adapted as:
- A service offering (AI life/business audit)
- A template for Marb's own automation consulting
- A starting point for building automated audit agents

## Action Items
- [ ] Consider adapting this prompt for XPERIENCE client onboarding
- [ ] Could build a streamlined version as an OpenClaw skill
