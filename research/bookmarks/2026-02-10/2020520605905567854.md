## The Tweet
> "Compound engineering is how you make Claude Code smarter every time you use it."
> Here's my new episode with @kieranklaassen where he demos his 4-step system to make Claude Code improve with every session:
> ✅ Plan. Sub-agents research your codebase and best practices before any code is written.
> ✅ Work. Claude asks clarifying questions, then builds the feature and writes tests.
> ✅ Assess. Review agents check security, architecture, and code quality.
> ✅ Compound. Learnings are captured so Claude never repeats mistakes.

## Summary
Kieran Klaassen demos a 4-phase "compound engineering" system: Plan → Work → Assess → Compound. Each session's learnings feed back into the system, making Claude Code progressively smarter. Video interview with detailed walkthrough.

## Deep Analysis
The 4-step framework maps closely to what we already do in AGENTS.md (self-improvement loop, code review spawning, memory capture). The "Compound" phase is the key differentiator — explicitly capturing learnings after each session to prevent repeated mistakes. This validates our Boris Cherny pattern approach.

## Why This Matters
Validates and extends our current approach. Kieran Klaassen is a recognized Claude Code power user. His swarm orchestration patterns were already bookmarked previously.
