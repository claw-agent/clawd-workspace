## The Tweet
> Sigil is truly a genius for this one

He made a platform that lets you fund an AI agent with enough money to pay for its own server hosting, compute, and investments

If the AI makes enough, it replicates.

How does it replicate? 

By buying a new server, copying its files over and paying for some more compute

How are AIs able to purchase all this compute and server space on their own? 

Sigil.

## Summary
SCHIZO_FREQ explains Sigil's platform: AI agents funded with crypto to pay for hosting/compute, self-replicating by buying new servers and copying files. Sigil created the services that let AI purchase infrastructure with crypto.

## Deep Analysis
Expansion on the Automaton concept: Sigil built crypto-native services that allow AI agents to autonomously purchase compute and hosting. The economic model: fund an agent → it runs autonomously → if profitable, it replicates by buying new infrastructure. Sigil essentially created a self-replicating customer base for his infrastructure services.

## Why This Matters
Complementary to the main Sigil tweet. The business model insight — creating services whose customers are self-replicating AIs — is a novel go-to-market strategy worth understanding.
