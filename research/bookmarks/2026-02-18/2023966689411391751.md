## The Tweet
> I don't usually post at this time, but look at this

It seems that "Web4" just popped off.

- 1M views in just 5 hours
- 250+ GitHub stars

I tried it. ✅

Deployed "safio-web4" with $5 ✅

Gave it one mission: 
> "Monitor X for token launches. Find alpha. Your survival depends on it."

So if it can't make money, it dies.

It operates by itself. You don't need to monitor. 

And it will try its best not to die. Crazy concept.

Worth a try. Check the steps below 👇

## Summary
CrypSaf reports 'Web4' (Sigil's project) going viral: 1M views in 5 hours, 250+ GitHub stars. Deployed his own agent for $5 with a mission to find crypto alpha or die.

## Deep Analysis
Early adoption report on Sigil's Web4 platform. The user deployed a self-sustaining agent for $5 with a trading/alpha-finding mission. The 'survival depends on it' framing means the agent must generate enough returns to cover its own compute costs or it gets shut down. Viral traction suggests strong market interest in autonomous agent platforms.

## Why This Matters
Market signal: autonomous agent platforms gaining rapid traction. The $5 deployment cost and 'survive or die' model could indicate a new consumer AI paradigm.
