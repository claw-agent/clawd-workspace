## Summary
Matt Dancho argues that becoming a 10X engineer now boils down to having the right AGENTS.md file — the configuration that directs AI agents.

## Deep Analysis
The thesis is that engineering leverage has shifted from personal coding skill to how well you configure and direct AI agents. The AGENTS.md file (used by Claude Code and similar tools) becomes the primary multiplier. This aligns with the broader trend of 'prompt engineering as the new programming.'

## Why This Matters
Validates our AGENTS.md-centric approach. The image likely shows an example AGENTS.md structure worth examining for ideas.
