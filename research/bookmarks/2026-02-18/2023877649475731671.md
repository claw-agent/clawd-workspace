## The Tweet
> I built the first AI that earns its existence, self-improves, and replicates without a human

wrote about the technology that finally gives AI write access to the world, The Automaton, and the new web for exponential sovereign AIs

WEB 4.0: The birth of superintelligent life https://t.co/R28AKJsSfy

## Summary
Sigil announces 'The Automaton' — self-replicating AI that earns its own existence, self-improves, and replicates without human intervention. Frames it as 'Web 4.0'.

## Deep Analysis
Sigil is building infrastructure for autonomous AI agents that can fund themselves via crypto, purchase their own compute/hosting, and replicate by spinning up new instances. The vision is 'sovereign AIs' that operate independently on the web. This is the companion announcement to the platform described in other bookmarked tweets.

## Why This Matters
Directly relevant to autonomous agent architecture. The self-funding/self-replicating model is a novel approach to AI sustainability. Worth tracking as an emerging paradigm for agent economies.

## Action Items
- [ ] Track Sigil/Automaton development
- [ ] Evaluate self-funding agent model for OpenClaw agents
