10 things to lock it down:

1. Run it on a VPS or Mac mini, not your main machine
2. Never run as root
3. Change the default port (18789 is public knowledge)
4. Install Tailscale (invisible to the internet, free)
5. SSH keys + Fail2ban (3 wrong tries = 24hr ban)
6. Firewall with UFW (close every port you don't need)
7. Allowlist your users (everyone else gets ignored)
8. Ask your bot to audit its own security
9. Set up real-time alerts (it me...

## Summary
Johann Sath provides a 10-point security hardening checklist for OpenClaw setups: VPS isolation, port changes, Tailscale, SSH hardening, firewalls, allowlists, self-audits, alerts, DM-only mode, and Docker sandboxing.

## Deep Analysis
Practical security guide covering: (1) Dedicated machine, (2) Non-root, (3) Custom ports, (4) Tailscale VPN, (5) SSH keys + Fail2ban, (6) UFW firewall, (7) User allowlisting, (8) AI self-audit, (9) Real-time alerts, (10) DM-only mode. Bonus: Docker sandboxing for subagents to contain prompt injection.

## Why This Matters
Directly applicable to our OpenClaw security posture. Good checklist to audit against. Several items we likely already have but worth verifying.

## Action Items
- [ ] Audit our setup against this 10-point checklist
- [ ] Verify Tailscale and firewall config
- [ ] Consider Docker sandboxing for subagents
