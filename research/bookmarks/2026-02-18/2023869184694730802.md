## Summary
The Vault promotes an interview with @mackrmrz — a Gen Z creative director running agency-scale operations solo using AI agents (Claude Code + Obsidian + Agent SDK).

## Deep Analysis
Mack shares his full stack: Claude Code terminals (3-5 open simultaneously), Obsidian as operating system, Agent SDK for custom agents, Nano Banana Pro for images, Kling 3 for video, DaVinci Resolve for editing. Key workflow: wake up → check Obsidian briefing → direct agents like a creative director. He's building an 'AI integrator' business — going deep with e-com brands to help them scale creative assets internally. Advocates for 'systemizing' as the key meta-skill and sees AI integration consulting as an entire new career field.

## Why This Matters
Validates the solo operator + AI agents model. His Obsidian-as-OS pattern mirrors our AGENTS.md approach. The 'AI integrator' business model is worth noting — integrating AI systems for existing businesses with cash flow. His Agent SDK emphasis suggests it's becoming essential infrastructure.
