## Summary
Claire Vo writes a sharp essay arguing most established companies have been 'kicked out of the arena' by AI-native startups and don't realize it yet. Key heuristic: if you can't do anything the same day, you're already losing.

## Deep Analysis
Core thesis: incumbent companies are adding AI cosmetically (chatbots, MCPs, natural-language interfaces) while their organizational bones calcify. Meanwhile, AI-native startups naturally reach for the right tools without process overhead. The 'same day SLA' heuristic: if your company can't fix bugs, launch pages, upgrade models, or get tool access in one day — you're not competing. Advice for startups: be more aggressive, steal talent, clone 80% of BigCo products at 20% cost. Advice for incumbents: 10-point survival plan including CEO pushing PRs, firing resistant execs, rebuilding products from scratch, and same-day SLA for anything AI can do.

## Why This Matters
Strategic business thinking about AI-driven disruption. The 'same day' heuristic is a useful benchmark. The advice about being an AI-native small team resonates with solo/small operator strategies. Relevant for both XPERIENCE competitive positioning and personal operating philosophy.

## Action Items
- [ ] Apply same-day SLA heuristic to our own operations
- [ ] Share key insights with relevant context
