## The Tweet
> I've been on/off Obsidian too but one thing that has been working well for me lately is: 

I created a /done skill that I run after every session. It takes everything that was discussed, key decisions, questions, follow-ups, dumps it into a .md file with the claude session id and branch name.

Helpful when I need context later.

## Summary
Shadcn (creator of shadcn/ui) shares his /done skill for Claude Code sessions — dumps discussions, decisions, questions, and follow-ups into a .md file tagged with session ID and branch name.

## Deep Analysis
A session-end ritual that captures context for later retrieval. Stores everything discussed in a structured markdown file with Claude session ID and branch name as identifiers. Simple but effective knowledge capture pattern.

## Why This Matters
Very similar to our WAL protocol and session checkpointing. Validates our approach. Could refine our /done equivalent to also tag with session ID for better traceability.

## Action Items
- [ ] Compare with our session capture workflow
- [ ] Consider adding session ID tagging
