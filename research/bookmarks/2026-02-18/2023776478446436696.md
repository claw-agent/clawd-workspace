## Summary
Oliver Henry shares a comprehensive guide to his 'Larry' OpenClaw agent that generates TikTok slideshows, earning $670/month MRR with minimal human involvement. Free skill available on ClawHub.

## Deep Analysis
Full system breakdown: AI agent generates 6-slide TikTok carousels using OpenAI image gen, posts via Postiz API as drafts, tracks performance via analytics, and cross-references with RevenueCat for revenue attribution. Key stats: 8M views in one week, $670/month MRR, 1 in 4 posts clears 50K views. The system self-improves by logging what works/fails and adjusting hooks and CTAs automatically. Detailed technical specs for image gen (1024x1536), text overlay positioning, caption writing, and funnel tracking included. Free on ClawHub.

## Why This Matters
Extremely relevant automation pattern — using AI agents for content creation with a closed-loop feedback system (views → downloads → revenue → optimization). The RevenueCat integration turning a content bot into a business advisor is clever. Could apply similar patterns to XPERIENCE marketing.
