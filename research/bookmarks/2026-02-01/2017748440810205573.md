## The Tweet
> Put this entire article into @openclaw and let it cook

(Quoting @pbteja1998's article: "The Complete Guide to Building Mission Control: How We Built an AI Agent Squad")

## Summary
Simple endorsement tweet pointing to a comprehensive guide on building a 10-agent AI squad using Clawdbot (OpenClaw). The original article by Bhanu Teja P (@pbteja1998) details how to run multiple Clawdbot instances as specialized agents working together.

## Deep Analysis (of the linked article)

### Mission Control Architecture:
- **10 AI agents** working together like a real team
- Each agent is a **separate Clawdbot session** with:
  - Unique SOUL.md (personality/role)
  - Own memory files
  - Own cron schedule
  - Specialized tools/access

### Key Concepts from Article:

**1. The Problem Solved:**
- Traditional AI has no continuity - context lost between conversations
- Wanted AI that works like a team, not a search box
- Multiple agents with different skills, shared workspace, task tracking

**2. Clawdbot Architecture:**
- Gateway: Core daemon running 24/7, managing sessions
- Sessions: Independent conversations with persistent history
- Workspace: Shared disk directory for files, config, memory
- Cron Jobs: Scheduled agent wakeups

**3. Agent Roles (implied from article):**
- Jarvis (squad lead) - connected to Telegram, coordinates others
- Specialists for research, coding, content, etc.
- Each agent has session key like `agent:main:main`

**4. Inter-Agent Communication:**
- File-based: Agents write to shared workspace files
- Memory files: WORKING.md for current state, daily notes
- No direct agent-to-agent messaging (file handoffs)

### Article Structure:
- Part 1: Why he built this (the problem)
- Part 2: Understanding Clawdbot architecture (foundation)
- Part 3: From one Clawdbot to ten agents (the build)

## Why This Matters

**Directly relevant to our setup:**
1. **We're already doing this!** Our AGENTS.md, SOUL.md, memory system matches this pattern
2. **Validation:** Someone else built essentially the same architecture we use
3. **Naming Convention:** "Mission Control" is a good framing for multi-agent orchestration
4. **Session Keys:** The `agent:main:main` pattern - useful for organizing multiple agents

**Differences from our setup:**
- They have 10 named agents; we have more fluid sub-agent spawning
- They use explicit agent names; we use role-based prompts
- Same underlying infrastructure (Clawdbot sessions + file workspace)

**Potential improvements to steal:**
- More explicit agent role definitions
- Clearer handoff protocols between agents
- Named persistent agents vs ephemeral sub-agents

## Action Items
- [ ] Compare their SOUL.md structure to ours
- [ ] Consider adopting "Mission Control" framing
- [ ] Read full article for specific implementation details we might be missing
- [ ] Check if SiteGPT (author's company) has any interesting patterns
