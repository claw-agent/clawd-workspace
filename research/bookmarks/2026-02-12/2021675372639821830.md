## The Tweet
> a bunch of you said this would be huge for real estate 🏡 so i pushed it further: virtual staging just went 3d 👀
> Flow: 1. capture 16 ultra-wide photos → 2. stitch into 360° panorama → 3. feed into @NanoBanana with staging prompt → 4. reconstruct into navigable 3D world using @theworldlabs

## Summary
Combining 360° panoramas + AI virtual staging + 3D reconstruction to create fully navigable staged spaces for real estate. Pipeline: iPhone capture → panorama stitch → NanoBanana AI staging → World Labs 3D.

## Deep Analysis
This is a compelling real estate tech workflow:
- **Teleport app** for 360° iPhone panoramas (author is founder)
- **NanoBanana** for AI-powered virtual staging of the panorama
- **World Labs** for converting 2D staged panorama into navigable 3D
- The result is a virtual staged walkthrough from just photos

The real estate application is obvious and high-value. Virtual staging is already a $500-2000/listing service. 3D walkthroughs add premium value.

## Why This Matters
Direct XPERIENCE opportunity — real estate clients would pay for this. Also demonstrates multi-tool AI pipelines that could be productized.

## Action Items
- [ ] Evaluate NanoBanana and World Labs for XPERIENCE real estate services
- [ ] Consider building a virtual staging automation workflow
