## The Tweet
> Most people bookmark tweets and never look at them again. So I built an openclaw skill that reads your bookmarks and tells your agent what to actually do with them. It categorizes everything, extracts actions, and proposes work it can start on right now.

## Summary
OpenClaw skill that processes Twitter bookmarks into actionable items — categorizes, extracts actions, and proposes tasks for the agent. Meta-relevant since we literally run bookmark analysis.

## Deep Analysis
This is essentially a competitor/complement to our scout-alpha bookmark analysis. Key differences to evaluate:
- Does it integrate as an OpenClaw skill (vs our custom protocol)?
- Does it go beyond analysis to propose actionable work?
- Could we adopt or improve from their approach?

The "proposes work it can start on right now" angle is interesting — our system analyzes but doesn't auto-propose tasks.

## Why This Matters
Directly relevant to our bookmark research pipeline. Could upgrade or replace parts of scout-alpha.

## Action Items
- [ ] Install and evaluate this skill
- [ ] Compare approach with our scout-alpha protocol
- [ ] Consider integrating "propose actions" feature into our pipeline
