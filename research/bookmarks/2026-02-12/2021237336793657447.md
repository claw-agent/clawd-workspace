## The Tweet
> Introducing Expressive Mode for ElevenAgents - voice agents so expressive, they blur the line between AI and human conversations. This is an unedited recording of an agent empathizing with a customer at peak frustration.

## Summary
ElevenLabs released "Expressive Mode" for their voice agents platform. Claims natural emotional expression in AI voice calls — empathy, frustration handling, etc. Unedited demo of customer service call.

## Deep Analysis
This is a significant voice AI advancement:
- **Expressive Mode** adds emotional nuance to AI voice agents
- **ElevenAgents** is their voice agent platform
- Demo shows empathy during frustrated customer interaction
- Competes directly with human call center agents

This is relevant because we already use ElevenLabs alternatives (Qwen-TTS, edge-tts). Their agent platform could be useful for XPERIENCE customer service automation.

## Why This Matters
Voice AI for customer service is directly applicable to XPERIENCE. The expressive mode could make AI phone agents viable for local businesses.
