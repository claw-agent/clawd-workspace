## The Tweet
> A super interesting new study from Harvard Business Review. A 8-month field study at a US tech company with about 200 employees found that AI use did not shrink work, it intensified it, and made employees busier. Task expansion happened because AI filled in gaps in knowledge, so people started doing work that used to belong to other roles or would have been outsourced or deferred. That shift created extra coordination and review work for specialists, including fixing AI-assisted drafts and coordinating across newly blurred role boundaries.

## Summary
Harvard Business Review study reveals AI paradox: rather than reducing workload, AI expanded task scope and made employees busier. Workers took on tasks previously outside their role, creating more coordination overhead.

## Deep Analysis
This is a critical finding that challenges the "AI will free up your time" narrative. The study found:
1. **Task expansion** — AI lowered barriers to entry on tasks, so people took on MORE work
2. **Coordination overhead** — Specialists had to review/fix AI-assisted drafts from non-specialists
3. **Role boundary blurring** — People doing work that used to belong to other roles
4. **Net increase in busyness** — Despite AI "efficiency," total work increased

This validates the pattern we see: AI doesn't reduce work, it changes the nature of work and expands what's possible/expected.

## Why This Matters
Directly relevant to how Marb structures AI workflows. The lesson: use AI to expand capability, not just speed up existing work. Plan for coordination costs when deploying AI across roles.

## Action Items
- [ ] Consider this when advising businesses on AI adoption (XPERIENCE)
- [ ] Factor coordination overhead into agent workflow design
