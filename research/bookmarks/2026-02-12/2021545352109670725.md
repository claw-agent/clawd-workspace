## The Tweet
> Let me show you how to use Claude Code for outbound. It's like having 10k SDRs working for you. The system runs on 11 APIs and 72 automation scripts. Instead of building rigid workflows that break and miss context, I give agents access to tools and let them figure out what to do based on my subject matter expertise stored in Skills.

## Summary
Outbound sales automation system using Claude Code + 11 APIs + 72 scripts. Key insight: store expertise in Skills, let agents figure out execution rather than rigid workflows.

## Deep Analysis
Architecture highlights:
- Skills-based approach (expertise as context, not rigid scripts)
- 11 APIs for data enrichment and outreach
- 72 automation scripts
- Agent-driven campaign generation from positioning frameworks

The "let agents figure it out" philosophy aligns with Karpathy's declarative-over-imperative advice. This is enterprise-grade outbound automation.

## Why This Matters
Outbound automation is a high-value service for XPERIENCE clients. The skills-based architecture is worth studying.

## Action Items
- [ ] Study the 11-API stack for potential adoption
- [ ] Consider building an outbound skill for XPERIENCE
