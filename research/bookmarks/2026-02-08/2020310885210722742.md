## The Tweet
> There's a problem nobody warns you about with @OpenClaw bots. Your gateway crashes silently. No error. No alert. You message your bot and get nothing back... I had my bot build a watchdog that monitors itself. Now it checks if the gateway is responding, auto-restarts, and sends notifications.

## Summary
OpenClaw gateway reliability issue and solution: gateways crash silently with no notification. Author built a self-monitoring watchdog that auto-restarts the gateway and sends alerts. Shares the exact prompt to have your bot build one.

## Deep Analysis
We've experienced this exact issue. The shared prompt is a "steal this" template for building a watchdog. Our setup already has some monitoring, but this validates the need for robust self-healing infrastructure.

Key insight: The bot can't tell you it's down because the gateway IS the connection. You need out-of-band monitoring.

## Why This Matters
Directly relevant — we run OpenClaw and have had gateway issues. Good validation that our monitoring approach is correct.

## Action Items
- [ ] Verify our gateway watchdog is robust enough
- [ ] Compare our approach to this one
