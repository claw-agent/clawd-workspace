## The Tweet
> Claude Code just shipped agent teams. Here's how to build your own marketing department inside it.

## Summary
Detailed walkthrough of Claude Code's experimental "agent teams" feature — multiple Claude instances working together with a lead coordinator and teammates executing in parallel. Shows marketing-specific use cases: campaign research sprints, landing page builds, ad creative exploration, and content production. Includes setup instructions and best practices.

## Deep Analysis
Key patterns that map to our setup:
- **Lead + teammates model** = orchestrator + sub-agents (we already do this with sessions_spawn)
- **Plan approval before execution** = good governance pattern
- **Adversarial review** = having agents challenge each other's work
- **"Don't let teammates edit the same files"** = aligns with our CooperBench rules in AGENTS.md

The marketing applications are strong: parallel research, multi-perspective content creation, built-in QA loops. This is essentially what the swarm v2 system could do.

Setup: `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` in settings.json.

## Why This Matters
Shows the evolution of multi-agent coordination. Our AGENTS.md already has similar patterns. Could upgrade our sub-agent spawning to use formal team structures.

## Action Items
- [ ] Test Claude Code agent teams feature
- [ ] Compare with our current sessions_spawn approach
