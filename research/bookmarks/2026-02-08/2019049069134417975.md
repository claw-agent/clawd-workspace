## The Tweet
> The Agent Will Eat Your System of Record

## Summary
Thesis: AI agents will collapse the "system of record" moat that enterprise software (Salesforce, Workday, NetSuite) has relied on for decades. The data in these systems is surprisingly small (megabytes to gigabytes). Once agents have API access, they cache everything locally, making the original system irrelevant. "We store your data" is no longer a moat.

## Deep Analysis
Core argument chain:
1. Systems of record are defensible because data is trapped in their UI
2. AI agents need API access to be useful → they pull all the data
3. The data is small enough to copy entirely
4. Agent becomes the primary interface, not the app
5. Rate limits just create caching, which makes the SoR even more irrelevant
6. Only governance/compliance might survive, but that's a feature, not a platform

**What survives:** Workflow automation, network effects, deep domain expertise. NOT "we hold your data."

**Implications for building:** Don't build systems of record — build agent-native tools, or build the agent layer itself.

## Why This Matters
Strategic insight for any software Marb builds. Don't bet on data lock-in. The agent layer is where value accrues. Also signals opportunity: agent-native CRM/tools that assume agents are the primary users.

## Action Items
- [ ] Think about XPERIENCE tools through this lens — are we building agent-native?
- [ ] Opportunity: agent-first CRM for contractors?
