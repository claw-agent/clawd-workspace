## The Tweet
> Welcome to February 7, 2026 — a comprehensive daily AI news digest covering major developments.

## Summary
Massively detailed daily AI digest. Key highlights: Mac Mini racks hosting OpenClaw agents as "24/7 employees" in China; SemiAnalysis projects Claude Code = 20% of GitHub commits by year-end; OpenAI requiring all employees to code via agents by March 31; Claude Opus 4.6 takes #1 on Vals Index and Code/Text Arenas; rabbit brain cryopreservation breakthrough; SpaceX pivoting to Moon disassembly for AI data centers; Palmer Luckey's Erebor Bank gets national charter.

## Deep Analysis
This is an incredible density of signal. Most relevant items:

1. **OpenClaw agents as employees** — Chinese companies running Mac Mini racks with OpenClaw agents 24/7. This is literally what Marb is doing. Validates the approach.
2. **Claude Code = 20% of GitHub commits** — massive adoption curve for agent-driven development
3. **OpenAI banning direct editor use** — agents as mandatory interface, not optional
4. **Opus 4.6 #1 everywhere** — confirms our model choice
5. **Prediction markets: Anthropic 67%** to have best model end of Feb
6. **Grok 4.20 dominates finance** — 34% return in trading sim. Worth watching for financial applications.
7. **"AIs will be the largest population on the internet"** — build for agents, not just humans

## Why This Matters
Validates the entire agent-first thesis Marb is building on. The Mac Mini OpenClaw farms in China = exactly the pattern. Also signals that Opus 4.6 is the right model choice right now.
