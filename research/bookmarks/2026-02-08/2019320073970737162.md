## The Tweet
> A+ post - "what is absolutely part of this whole arc are people who are certain we are less than five years away and are in a rush to build with absolute belief in where things are heading, and people who support them with their labor or dollars."

## Quoted: Steven Sinofsky (@stevesi) — "Death of Software. Nah."

## Summary
Anish Acharya (a16z) endorses Steven Sinofsky's long-form essay arguing software is NOT dead despite AI hype. Sinofsky draws parallels to PC→internet, retail→ecommerce, and media→streaming transitions — all took far longer than predicted, created MORE not less of the thing they were supposed to kill. His thesis: AI will create vastly more software demand, not less. Domain expertise becomes more important, not less.

## Deep Analysis
Sinofsky's 5 predictions:
1. **More software than ever** — demand for software far exceeds current supply
2. **AI moves up the stack** — doesn't replace software, adds a new layer
3. **New tools for new things** — most processes aren't yet software-improved
4. **Domain expertise matters MORE** — every domain gets more sophisticated
5. **Some companies won't make it** — but on generational timelines, not quarterly

The historical parallels are compelling. Every "X will kill Y" prediction led to MORE of Y, not less. Mainframes didn't die. Retail didn't die. Media didn't die. Software won't die.

## Why This Matters
Strategic framing for Marb's building philosophy. Be one of the "people certain we are less than five years away, building with absolute belief." But also understand it's a decade-long arc, not a quarter.
