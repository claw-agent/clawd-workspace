## The Tweet
> CLAUDE CODE but for HACKING
>
> its called shannon, you point it at website and it just... tries to break in... fully autonomous with no human needed
>
> i pointed it at a test app and it stole the entire user database, created admin accounts, and bypassed login, all by itself, in 90 minutes

## Summary
Shannon is an autonomous hacking agent built on Claude Code's architecture. You point it at a target and it autonomously finds and exploits vulnerabilities — SQL injection, auth bypass, privilege escalation — without human intervention. Demo shows it compromising a test app in 90 minutes.

## Deep Analysis
This is the offensive security version of what Claude Code does for development. The implications are massive:
- **Red teaming at scale** — companies could run this against their own infrastructure continuously
- **Arms race** — if attackers have autonomous pen-testing, defenders need autonomous defense
- **Claude Code as platform** — shows the agent-coding paradigm extending beyond software dev into security, hacking, and other domains
- The viral engagement (21K+ combined) shows massive interest in autonomous security tools

## Why This Matters
Directly relevant to AI agents and security. If Marb is building agent-powered services, understanding both offensive and defensive AI security is critical. Also shows market appetite for "Claude Code but for X" tools.

## Action Items
- [ ] Look into Shannon — is it open source? Could be useful for pen-testing XPERIENCE infrastructure
- [ ] Consider: "Claude Code but for [domain]" as a product pattern
