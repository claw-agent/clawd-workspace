## The Tweet
> you're vibe coding when you should be vibe marketing (with claude code, openclaw etc)

> 1. opus 4.6 / codex 5.3 → ship the product
> 2. claude code → design the playbook
> 3. openclaw → run the playbook 24/7
> 4. dashboards → decide what to double down on
>
> most founders stop at step 1. the money/opportunity is steps 2–5.
> media is the most mispriced asset right now.

## Summary
Greg Isenberg argues founders over-index on vibe coding (building products with AI) but ignore "vibe marketing" — using the same AI tools to run marketing 24/7. The stack: build with Opus/Codex, design playbook with Claude Code, run it autonomously with OpenClaw, measure with dashboards.

## Deep Analysis
This perfectly describes what Marb could be doing with OpenClaw + the swarm system:
- **Step 1:** Already done (roof estimator, tools)
- **Step 2:** Design marketing playbooks (content formats, hooks, campaigns)
- **Step 3:** OpenClaw runs them 24/7 (drafting content, responding, managing campaigns)
- **Step 4:** Track what works and double down

The "media is the most mispriced asset" framing is powerful. Building is commoditized. Distribution/attention is the bottleneck.

## Why This Matters
High-signal from a respected builder. Validates the OpenClaw-as-marketing-engine thesis. Marb is already at step 1 — this is the roadmap for steps 2-4.

## Action Items
- [ ] Design a "vibe marketing" playbook for XPERIENCE using this framework
- [ ] Consider content automation pipeline: Claude designs, OpenClaw executes
