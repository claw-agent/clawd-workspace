## The Tweet
> A detailed walkthrough of sending 500 personalized cold emails using Opus 4.6 in 10 minutes.

## Summary
Step-by-step guide for AI-powered cold outreach: (1) Pull leads from useotter.app API, (2) Scrape each company's website with Firecrawl for context, (3) Generate hyper-personalized 4-sentence emails with Opus 4.6 referencing specific company details. Total cost: ~$10 for 500 emails.

## Deep Analysis
The stack is clever and directly applicable:
- **Lead sourcing:** useotter.app — startup directory with emails (free)
- **Context enrichment:** Firecrawl scrapes company sites to markdown ($0.19-$2.10)
- **Personalization:** Opus 4.6 writes emails referencing scraped specifics (~$8/500)
- **Key insight:** The personalization isn't generic — it references actual products, features, and pain points from scraped content

This is essentially what Marb's swarm v2 outreach agent could do. The Firecrawl integration is the missing piece — enriching leads with web-scraped context before generating personalized outreach.

## Why This Matters
Directly applicable to XPERIENCE roofing outreach and any future business development. The Firecrawl + Opus pattern could power the outreach agent in Marb's swarm system.
