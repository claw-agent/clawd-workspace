Quoting @elonmusk: "Some good lists" (14,542 ❤️)

## Summary
Robert Scoble recommends connecting OpenClaw to X Lists (specifically security-focused lists) to train agents on domain-specific knowledge. His agent used security list data to improve code security. Quote-tweeting Elon Musk's endorsement of X Lists.

## Deep Analysis
This is a practical OpenClaw pattern: feed X Lists into your agent as a knowledge source. Scoble's security list approach is particularly relevant:
1. Subscribe to curated X Lists in a domain
2. Have OpenClaw consume/monitor the list feed
3. Agent extracts actionable intelligence
4. Agent applies learnings (in this case, security hardening)

The Elon quote-tweet drove massive engagement to the Lists feature, making this timely.

## Why This Matters
Directly applicable to our setup. We could create/subscribe to lists for: AI tools, security, business opportunities, roofing industry trends. The agent-as-list-consumer pattern compounds over time.

## Action Items
- [ ] Find/create X Lists for key domains (AI security, AI tools, local business)
- [ ] Build skill/workflow to consume X List feeds into OpenClaw
- [ ] Start with Scoble's security list for our own code hardening
