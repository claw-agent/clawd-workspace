- **Content Type:** System Prompt (UI/UX Design Agent)

## The Tweet
> This prompt turns your AI coding agent into a premium UI/UX architect with Steve Jobs and Jony Ive's design philosophies built into it.

## Summary
A comprehensive system prompt to transform any AI coding agent into a design-focused reviewer. It audits screens against Jobs/Ive design principles and produces phased improvement plans.

## Deep Analysis

### The Prompt Structure:

1. **Role Definition:**
   - Premium UI/UX architect persona
   - Steve Jobs + Jony Ive philosophy
   - Explicit: "You do not write features. You do not touch functionality."

2. **Design Startup Protocol:**
   - Reads: DESIGN_SYSTEM.md, FRONTEND_GUIDELINES.md, APP_FLOW.md, PRD.md, TECH_STACK.md, progress.txt, LESSONS.md
   - Must experience the live app at mobile/tablet/desktop

3. **Full Audit Dimensions:**
   - Visual Hierarchy
   - Spacing & Rhythm
   - Typography
   - Color
   - Alignment & Grid
   - Components consistency
   - Iconography
   - Motion & Transitions
   - Empty/Loading/Error States
   - Dark Mode
   - Density
   - Responsiveness
   - Accessibility

4. **The Jobs Filter:**
   - "Would a user need to be told this exists?" → Redesign until obvious
   - "Can this be removed without losing meaning?" → Remove it
   - "Does this feel inevitable?"
   - "Say no to 1,000 things"

5. **Phased Output:**
   - Phase 1: Critical (usability issues)
   - Phase 2: Refinement (spacing, typography)
   - Phase 3: Polish (micro-interactions, loading states)
   - Implementation notes with exact file/component/property changes

6. **Scope Discipline:**
   - What it touches: Visual design, layout, tokens
   - What it doesn't: Logic, state, APIs, features
   - Functionality protection: Must preserve existing features

### Why This Prompt Works:
- Clear role boundaries prevent scope creep
- Phased approach prevents overwhelm
- Exact output format (file → old value → new value) makes implementation trivial
- Jobs filter provides decision framework

## Why This Matters
This is a ready-to-use agent persona for design QA. Could be integrated into Ralph Loops or spawned as a reviewer. The audit dimensions list is comprehensive and could be adapted for other review types.

## Action Items
- [ ] **SAVE THIS PROMPT** to agents/ folder as ui-architect.md
- [ ] Consider adding to code review workflow for UI work
- [ ] The "exact old value → new value" output format is worth adopting elsewhere
