## Summary
A workflow for project kickoff using Claude Opus 4.5 + Extended Thinking to generate a complete project skeleton that Claude Code can then execute.

## Deep Analysis

### The Workflow:

1. **Project Brain Dump:**
   - Fresh chat with Opus 4.5
   - Extended thinking ON
   - Dump everything about the project

2. **5-Question Interview:**
   > "ask me 5 questions that would help you have a complete understanding of this project"
   - Spend significant time answering these
   - This is the critical context-building phase

3. **Master Plan Generation:**
   > "you're my co-founder. create a master plan with a knowledge base directory for each section. attach context markdown files to every part. you're building the skeleton that Claude Code will use to build everything 10x faster. suggest skills to integrate, automations to build or any tool that'd 10x our speed. suggest when to use a project or Claude Code"

4. **Output:**
   - Complete file structure
   - Context markdown files for each section
   - Skill recommendations
   - Automation suggestions
   - Project vs Claude Code guidance

5. **Execution:**
   - Import files into Claude Code
   - Build systems alongside project
   - Spin up Claude Projects for specific tasks (research, writing, MCPs)

### Why This Works:
- Opus 4.5 + Extended Thinking = deep reasoning
- "Co-founder" framing gets more strategic output
- Pre-built skeleton accelerates Claude Code execution
- Clear handoff points between tools

## Why This Matters
This is essentially describing the "planning phase" of Ralph Loops. The "5 questions" technique is worth adopting. The explicit request for "skills to integrate" and "tools that'd 10x speed" is smart meta-prompting.

## Action Items
- [ ] The "5 questions" technique should be standard for project kickoffs
- [ ] Consider adding this workflow to Ralph Loops planning phase
- [ ] "Co-founder" framing is effective - use in other contexts
