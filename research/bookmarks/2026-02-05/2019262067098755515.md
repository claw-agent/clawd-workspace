**Quick take:** Ryan Carson (Treehouse founder) describing his OpenClaw setup: 7-agent security vulnerability sweep with automated fixing and learning compounding. Uses QMD for search. Notable that he's using the same tools we use (qmd, cron jobs, multi-agent orchestration). Validates our approach.
