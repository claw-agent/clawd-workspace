## The Take

Sam Lessin shares his skeptical view of the AI investment landscape.

### Point 1: Narrative Collusion & Funny Money
- Claims "narrative collusion between DC/SF/NYC finance" driven by debt crisis concerns
- Hopes for 7% GDP growth propping things up
- SpaceX example: $1T company with $16B revenue buying something with "basically NO revenue for fake 250B"
- (He's a SpaceX shareholder who loves the company)

### Point 2: The AGI Asymmetry Argument (via Sam Altman)
- The pitch: "if there's 1% chance of AGI swerve, can't be left out"
- Lessin's counter: the "race first for computers to wake up" now seems "pretty tenuous" vs "pure sci-fi story of 24 months ago"

### Point 3: Why Everyone Stays In
- **Big firms:** No reason to exit — worst case is unneeded infrastructure, best case is winning
- **Startups/VCs:** "Nowhere else to stuff all the money"

### His Conclusion:
> "The party will continue until it doesn't — but probably will for a while because everyone is aligned to make it continue for the sake of everyone... but at some point physics take back over"

## Why This Matters

Sam Lessin is a credible bear voice (Facebook VP, Slow Ventures). This is a contrarian take worth tracking:

1. **Valuation skepticism** — Questioning whether AI multiples make sense
2. **Incentive alignment** — Everyone wants the party to continue
3. **Physics eventually wins** — Fundamentals will matter at some point

**For us:** Useful mental model when evaluating AI-native business opportunities. Not bearish on building — bearish on hype multiples.
