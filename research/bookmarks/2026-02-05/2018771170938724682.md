## Summary
Major announcement: Claude Agent SDK is now natively integrated into Apple's Xcode IDE. This brings Claude Code-like functionality directly into the Apple development ecosystem for iOS, macOS, and visionOS development.

## Deep Analysis

### What This Means:

1. **Claude Goes Native on Apple:**
   - No more third-party tools needed for AI-assisted iOS/Mac development
   - Deep integration into Apple's primary IDE
   - Likely includes access to Apple frameworks, documentation, and best practices

2. **Strategic Implications:**
   - Anthropic + Apple partnership is significant
   - Competes directly with GitHub Copilot in Xcode
   - May include Apple Silicon optimizations

3. **Developer Impact:**
   - Swift developers get Claude Code workflow natively
   - Vision Pro development with AI assistance
   - Likely integrated with SwiftUI, UIKit, etc.

4. **For Agent Builders:**
   - iOS/macOS agents become easier to build
   - Apple's ecosystem opens up to AI-native apps
   - Could enable new agent capabilities on Apple platforms

### Missing Context:
- Need to check the linked article for SDK details
- Pricing model unclear (likely tied to Claude API)
- Whether it uses local models or cloud

## Why This Matters
This is a MAJOR industry move. Apple rarely integrates third-party AI. Anthropic getting this placement is huge for Claude's ecosystem. For Marb: if doing any Apple platform work, this is the tool to use.
