## Summary
Clear framing of AI career paths: API Callers (low leverage, soon automated, ~$150k) vs Architects (high leverage, builds the infrastructure, $500k+). Recommends Stanford's CS336 course for the Architect path.

## Deep Analysis

### The Two Paths:

**API Caller:**
- Uses existing APIs
- Low leverage
- First to be automated away
- ~$150k salary ceiling

**Architect:**
- Builds the APIs
- High leverage
- Creates tools others depend on
- $500k+ potential

### CS336: Language Modeling from Scratch
Stanford course that trains "Architects":

- **Lectures 3-4:** Transformers and Mixture of Experts
- **Lectures 5-8:** Performance and scale (GPUs, kernels, parallelism)
- **Lecture 10:** Inference and deployment
- **Lectures 13-14:** Data collection and curation
- **Lectures 15-17:** Alignment and reinforcement learning

### Why This Framing Resonates:
- Echoes Naval's "vibe coding vs model training" tweet
- Creates clear hierarchy: calling APIs < building APIs < building the models
- Provides actionable next step (CS336)

### Resource:
Link appears to be to CS336 course materials.

## Why This Matters
Reinforces the theme from Naval's tweet. For Marb's positioning: being an "Architect" means understanding the full stack, not just prompt engineering. This could inform what skills to develop next.

## Action Items
- [ ] Bookmark CS336 course for potential deep-dive
- [ ] Consider the "Architect vs API Caller" framing for content
- [ ] The syllabus topics are worth exploring individually
