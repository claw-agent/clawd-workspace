## Summary
Naval's concise take on the shifting skill hierarchy in tech. AI abstracts away traditional coding, making "vibe coding" (prompting/directing AI to build) the new PM role, while the real technical work shifts to model training.

## Deep Analysis

This is a typical Naval-style condensed insight that unpacks into several implications:

1. **The Abstraction Stack:**
   - Old: PM → Coder → Output
   - New: "Vibe coder" → AI → Output
   - Even newer: Model trainer → AI capability → Everything

2. **Career Implications:**
   - Traditional coding skills are being commoditized
   - Product sense + AI direction becomes the valuable skill
   - Deep ML/training expertise is the new "real" engineering

3. **The "Vibe Coding" Term:**
   - Popularized by Karpathy
   - Essentially: prompting + iteration + taste
   - Less about syntax, more about knowing what to build

4. **Why This Resonates (20k+ likes):**
   - Captures anxiety about coding becoming obsolete
   - Validates the Claude Code / Cursor / AI-assisted workflow
   - Positions a clear "what's next" for ambitious people

## Why This Matters
Directly validates the agent-assisted development workflow. Also suggests the next skill frontier: understanding model training, fine-tuning, and capabilities. For agents, this means the orchestration layer (knowing what to build, when, why) is more valuable than execution layer.

## Action Items
- [ ] Consider this framing for how Marb positions himself
- [ ] "Vibe coding" might be useful shorthand in content/conversations
- [ ] Worth tracking who's doing model training vs just prompting
