## Summary
A comprehensive "Jarvis Initialization" prompt that interviews a user to fully understand them, then generates structured system files for OpenClaw/Claude Code.

## Deep Analysis

### The Philosophy:
"One conversation to make your AI understand you."
- Instead of prompting repeatedly, do one deep interview
- Generate all the context files upfront
- Agent operates proactively from day one

### Interview Categories:

1. **Identity** - Who you are, ecosystem structure
2. **Operations** - Daily rhythm, tools, responsibilities
3. **People** - Team, relationships, dependencies
4. **Resources** - Financial, energy, constraints
5. **Friction** - What's broken, bottlenecks, past failures
6. **Goals and Dreams** - All timeframes, endgame
7. **Cognition** - Decision making, priorities, energy management
8. **Content and Learning** - What you create/consume
9. **Communication** - Style preferences
10. **Codebases** - Repos, architecture, tribal knowledge
11. **Integrations** - Platforms, data flows
12. **Voice and Soul** - Personality, character references
13. **Automation** - What runs autonomously vs needs approval
14. **Mission Control** - Project/task tracking preferences
15. **Memory and Boundaries** - What to remember, off-limits areas

### Output Files Generated:
- MEMORY.md
- SKILLS_AND_AGENTS.md
- GOALS_AND_DREAMS.md
- RESPONSIBILITIES.md
- AUTOMATION.md
- INTEGRATIONS.md
- SECURITY.md
- VOICE.md
- MISSION_CONTROL.md
- NUCLEUS.md (model preferences)
- CODEBASES/ directory

### Prompt Principles:
- Simple, clear questions (no jargon)
- 10-15 questions per batch minimum
- Know when to stop
- Never assume - clarify always

## Why This Matters
This is essentially what SOUL.md + USER.md + MEMORY.md tries to do, but structured as an interview process. The categories are comprehensive. Could be used to improve our own onboarding or generate better context files.

## Action Items
- [ ] **HIGH PRIORITY**: Compare this structure to our SOUL.md/USER.md
- [ ] Consider running through this interview to improve our context files
- [ ] The output file structure is worth adopting
- [ ] Save prompt to agents/ folder as jarvis-init.md
