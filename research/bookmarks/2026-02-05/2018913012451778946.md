## The Tweet
> Tomorrow is an extremely important day
>
> A massive, landscape shifting technology will drop
>
> Anthropic will release Sonnet 5. It will be smarter than the already smartest model out there, Opus 4.5
>
> It will be half the price, double the speed, and be able to spin up swarms of agents

## Summary
Alex Finn hyping Sonnet 5 release. Claims: smarter than Opus 4.5, 50% cheaper, 2x faster, native agent swarm capabilities.

## Deep Analysis

### Claims Made:
1. Smarter than Opus 4.5
2. Half the price
3. Double the speed
4. Native agent swarm capabilities

### Recommended Actions:
1. Have it code an app
2. Give it your todo list
3. Plug into Claude Code with complex tasks
4. Give it goals/ambitions, ask how it can help

### Context:
- This was posted Feb 4, eve of Sonnet 5 release
- The "swarm of agents" claim is interesting - suggests native multi-agent orchestration
- "ClawdBot" references throughout

### Reality Check:
- Need to verify these claims against actual release
- "Smarter than Opus 4.5" is bold - Opus 4.5 is reasoning-focused
- The price/speed claims are typical for Sonnet tier

## Why This Matters
If Sonnet 5 is actually this good, it changes agent economics significantly. Cheaper + faster + agent swarms = more aggressive automation possible. Worth benchmarking against current Opus 4.5 workflows.

## Action Items
- [ ] Once Sonnet 5 is released, test against current Opus workflows
- [ ] Check if "agent swarms" is a real feature or just marketing
- [ ] Update model selection heuristics in AGENTS.md if claims hold
