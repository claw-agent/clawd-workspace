## Summary
Comprehensive iOS App Store pre-launch checklist covering assets, technical setup, legal requirements, developer accounts, costs, and common gotchas.

## Deep Analysis

### The Checklist:

**1. App Store Assets:**
- [ ] App icon: 1024x1024 (no transparency)
- [ ] Screenshots: all device sizes
- [ ] App description under 4000 chars
- [ ] Privacy policy URL live
- [ ] Support email that works

**2. Technical Setup:**
- [ ] API keys moved to env variables
- [ ] Error tracking configured
- [ ] TestFlight tested on real devices
- [ ] All third-party SDKs approved versions
- [ ] Memory leaks checked

**3. Legal Requirements:**
- [ ] Privacy policy hosted
- [ ] Terms of service URL
- [ ] COPPA compliance if targeting kids
- [ ] Data collection declared accurately
- [ ] Age rating matches content

**4. Developer Accounts:**
- [ ] Apple: $99/year paid
- [ ] Google: $25 one-time paid
- [ ] Bundle ID matches everywhere
- [ ] Certificates not expired

**5. Cost Reality:**
- [ ] Hosting: $20-50/month
- [ ] Database: $0-30/month
- [ ] AI APIs: calculate per-user cost
- [ ] Payment processing: 2.9% + 0.30
- [ ] Push notifications: usually free tier works

### The Gotchas:
- Missing support email = instant rejection
- Wrong privacy policy = 2 week delay
- Expired certificates = build fails at 3am
- No error tracking = debugging blind
- Skip TestFlight = real device bugs

### Key Rule:
"If you can't check every box, don't submit yet. Every rejection adds a week to launch."

## Why This Matters
Practical checklist for iOS app launches. Worth saving for any Apple platform projects. The cost breakdown is realistic and helpful for planning.

## Action Items
- [ ] Save this checklist for future iOS projects
- [ ] Note the "$99/year Apple, $25 one-time Google" costs
- [ ] "TestFlight on real devices" is critical reminder
