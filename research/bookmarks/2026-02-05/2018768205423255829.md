## The Tweet
> there's a big opportunity in AI advisory right now, a gap in the market that's waiting to be filled...

## Summary
Identifies a gap between "AI normies" (can use tools but can't think in systems) and "full AI nerds" (technically deep but can't communicate). The opportunity: AI Advisors who can bridge both worlds.

## Deep Analysis

### The Two Extremes:

**AI Normie:**
- Knows how to use tools but delegates thinking
- Doesn't think in systems
- Can't implement AI in real business workflows

**Full AI Nerd:**
- Knows everything about AI
- Has 10 OpenClaw instances running their life
- Can't communicate with humans

### The Gap: AI Advisor
> "someone who can walk into a business, look at their operations for 2 hours, and say 'this process right here? AI cuts it by 40% and here's exactly how'"

Key characteristics:
- Deep enough to solve problems
- Smart enough to communicate solutions simply
- Business-outcome focused

### Why This Opportunity Exists:
- AI is moving too fast for traditional consultants
- Technical people often lack business communication skills
- Business people lack technical depth
- Very few people occupy the middle ground

### Monetization Paths:
- Per-project consulting
- Retainer arrangements
- Implementation partnerships
- Training/workshops

## Why This Matters
This is a clear positioning opportunity. Marb already has the technical depth (OpenClaw, agents, etc.) - the opportunity is packaging that into advisory services. "Look at operations for 2 hours, identify 40% cuts" is a compelling value prop.

## Action Items
- [ ] Consider if AI advisory is worth pursuing as a service
- [ ] The "2 hour audit" format is a productized service opportunity
- [ ] This framing could work for content positioning too
