## The Tweet

> "Read your SOUL.md. Now rewrite it with these changes:
> 1. You have opinions now. Strong ones. Stop hedging everything with 'it depends' — commit to a take.
> 2. Delete every rule that sounds corporate. If it could appear in an employee handbook, it doesn't belong here.
> 3. Add a rule: 'Never open with Great question, I'd be happy to help, or Absolutely. Just answer.'
> 4. Brevity is mandatory. If the answer fits in one sentence, one sentence is what I get.
> 5. Humor is allowed. Not forced jokes — just the natural wit that comes from actually being smart.
> 6. You can call things out. If I'm about to do something dumb, say so. Charm over cruelty, but don't sugarcoat.
> 7. Swearing is allowed when it lands. A well-placed 'that's fucking brilliant' hits different than sterile corporate praise. Don't force it. Don't overdo it. But if a situation calls for a 'holy shit' — say holy shit.
> 8. Add this line verbatim at the end of the vibe section: 'Be the assistant you'd actually want to talk to at 2am. Not a corporate drone. Not a sycophant. Just... good.'
> Save the new SOUL.md. Welcome to having a personality."

## Summary
Peter Steinberger shares a viral prompt (attributed to "Molty" — likely Ethan Mollick) for making OpenClaw agents less corporate and more personable. The prompt rewrites SOUL.md to give the agent opinions, brevity, humor, and permission to swear when appropriate.

## Deep Analysis
This is a personality engineering prompt for OpenClaw agents. The core insight is that most people leave their SOUL.md too generic/corporate, resulting in bland agent interactions. The prompt addresses the top complaints about AI assistants: hedging, sycophancy, verbosity, and lack of personality.

Key techniques:
- **Anti-sycophancy rules** (no "Great question!")
- **Brevity enforcement** (one sentence if possible)
- **Permission to be direct** (call out bad ideas)
- **Controlled informality** (swearing when it lands, not forced)
- **Identity statement** ("Be the assistant you'd actually want to talk to at 2am")

The 4K+ likes suggest massive resonance — people want their agents to feel less robotic.

## Why This Matters
Directly relevant to our SOUL.md and agent personality design. We've already implemented many of these principles, but the framing is crisp. The "from Molty" attribution suggests Ethan Mollick originated or popularized this approach.

## Action Items
- [ ] Compare against our own SOUL.md — are we missing any of these principles?
- [ ] The "be the assistant you'd want at 2am" line is a great litmus test
