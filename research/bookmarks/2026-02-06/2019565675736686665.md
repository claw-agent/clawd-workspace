## Summary
Quick checklist of essential Claude Code power-user tools: tmux for session management, skills for extensions, vim for editing, hooks for automation, claude.md for context, and git worktrees for parallel development.

## Deep Analysis

### Tool Breakdown

1. **tmux**
   - Terminal multiplexer for managing multiple sessions
   - Essential for long-running agents
   - Enables agent-spawning patterns (as seen in Tobi's Pi example)

2. **skills**
   - Claude Code's plugin/extension system
   - Drop-in capabilities for specialized tasks
   - We have several installed already

3. **vim**
   - Fast in-terminal editing
   - Claude Code can drive vim directly
   - Efficient for quick file changes

4. **hooks**
   - Lifecycle hooks for automation
   - Pre/post task triggers
   - Custom behaviors on events

5. **claude.md**
   - Context file for project guidelines
   - Equivalent to our AGENTS.md
   - Tells Claude how to work in this repo

6. **worktrees**
   - Git feature for parallel branches
   - Work on multiple features simultaneously
   - Each worktree is a separate directory

### What We're Using
- ✅ tmux (via OpenClaw sessions)
- ✅ skills (multiple installed)
- ⚠️ vim (available but not primary)
- ⚠️ hooks (using heartbeats, could do more)
- ✅ claude.md (AGENTS.md is our version)
- ❌ worktrees (not currently using)

## Why This Matters
Good checklist for power-user setup. We could adopt worktrees for parallel project work.

## Action Items
- [ ] Evaluate git worktrees for multi-project work
- [ ] Review hooks documentation for additional automation
- [ ] Consider vim integration for faster editing
