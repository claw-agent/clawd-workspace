## The Tweet
> Pi is the most interesting agent harness.

> Tiny core, able to write plugins for itself as you use it. It RLs itself into the agent you want.

> I was missing cc's tasks system and told it to spawn clause in tmux and interrogate it about it and make an implementation for itself. It nailed it, including the UX.

> Clawdbot is based on it and now it makes sense why it feels so magical. Dawn of the age of malleable software.

## Summary
Tobi Lutke reveals that Pi is the foundation behind Clawdbot's design. Pi is a self-modifying agent harness with a minimal core that writes its own plugins as you use it - essentially reinforcement learning itself into the agent you need.

## Deep Analysis

### Key Insights
1. **Pi's Architecture:** Tiny core + self-generated plugins. The agent literally writes extensions for itself during usage.

2. **Self-Improvement Loop:** "RLs itself into the agent you want" - the agent observes what you need and implements it, including UI/UX considerations.

3. **Practical Example:** Tobi wanted Claude Code's task system. He told Pi to spawn a Claude instance, interrogate it about the feature, and implement it for itself. It delivered, complete with good UX.

4. **Clawdbot Connection:** Clawdbot is based on Pi's architecture. This explains the "magic" - the malleable, self-extending nature.

5. **"Dawn of Malleable Software":** Bold thesis. Software that reshapes itself to user needs rather than users adapting to software.

### Technical Implications
- Agent harnesses are becoming self-modifying platforms
- The line between "using a tool" and "the tool learning you" is blurring
- Plugin/skill ecosystems might become self-generating
- tmux integration is key for spawning and managing sub-agents

## Why This Matters
This confirms a major architectural pattern: the best AI agents are self-extending systems. Our AGENTS.md approach (learn from corrections, update rules) is aligned with this philosophy. Could we make Claw more explicitly self-modifying?

## Action Items
- [ ] Research Pi architecture more deeply
- [ ] Consider how Claw could write its own skills
- [ ] Explore tmux-based agent spawning patterns
