## Summary
Thread on building a complete lead gen agent that replaces $5k/month agencies. Breaks down the agency model and proposes a single AI agent solution.

## Deep Analysis

### Agency Model Breakdown
1. **List Scraping:** AI-powered data collection
2. **Data Enrichment:** Adding contact info, company details
3. **Email Writing:** Personalized outreach at scale
4. **Send + Reply:** Automated sequences with responses

### The Disruption
- Agencies charge $5k/month + revenue share
- All 4 steps are now AI-automatable
- Single agent could replace entire agency

### Implementation Approach
Likely involves:
- Apollo/Clay/Scrapestack for lists
- Enrichment APIs (Apollo, Clearbit, etc.)
- LLM for personalized copy
- Email automation (Instantly, Smartlead, etc.)

## Why This Matters
**Directly relevant to SLC lead gen.** This is exactly the kind of system we could build. The economics are compelling — replace $5k/month with an agent that costs maybe $100/month in API calls.
