## Summary
Official release of the Memory Ledger Protocol (MLP) with standalone skills. The Reflection Engine component is now available as drop-in skills for Claude Code and OpenClaw.

## Deep Analysis

### What's Released
1. **SKILL.md for Claude Code** — Drop-in integration
2. **Standalone skill.md for OpenClaw** — Local storage version
3. **Full Stack for OpenClaw** — Encrypted IPFS storage
4. **Core Libraries** — For any agent framework

### Architecture
- **Multi-agent:** 3 Sonnet sub-agents handle reflection async
- **Cost:** ~$0.10-0.30 per session reflection
- **Benefit:** Memory compounds vs paying for context each time

### Key Insight
> "it's not performing familiarity (like all agents do right now) - it actually developed"

This is the core problem with current AI memory. Agents fake remembering by retrieving notes. MLP creates actual development through reflection.

### Sleep Metaphor
Riley compares this to human sleep/memory integration. During sleep, we consolidate memories, find patterns, integrate learnings. MLP does this explicitly for AI agents.

## Why This Matters
**CRITICAL.** This is production-ready code we can use immediately. The cost ($0.10-0.30/session) is reasonable for the benefit. Our current memory system is essentially "fancy logging" — this could upgrade it significantly.

## Action Items
- [ ] Clone the MLP repo immediately
- [ ] Review SKILL.md structure and adapt for Claw
- [ ] Test integration with our heartbeat system
- [ ] Evaluate cost vs benefit for daily usage
- [ ] Consider the encrypted IPFS option for persistence
