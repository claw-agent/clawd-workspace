## The Tweet
> you're vibe coding when you should be vibe marketing (with claude code, openclaw etc)
> 
> 1. opus 4.6 / codex 5.3 → ship the product (core features, backend, auth, infra)

## Summary
Greg Isenberg argues the real opportunity isn't in "vibe coding" (using AI to build products) but in "vibe marketing" - using the same AI tools (Claude Code, OpenClaw) to automate and scale marketing. The framework: use Opus/Codex to ship the product, then use AI agents to run marketing on autopilot.

## Deep Analysis
This is a strategic insight shift. The AI community is obsessed with building, but the money is in distribution. Greg (who previously called the $10M clawdbot consultancy opportunity) is now saying the next wave is AI-powered marketing automation. This directly applies to XPERIENCE's business model.

## Why This Matters
- XPERIENCE is a service business that needs marketing → AI marketing automation is directly relevant
- "Vibe marketing" framing could be a service offering: help businesses automate their marketing with AI
- Greg's influence means this will become a trend - early movers win

- [ ] Consider "vibe marketing" as a consulting service offering
