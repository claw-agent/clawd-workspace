## Summary
Siqi Chen (CEO of Runway Financial, prominent AI builder) describes a common Claude Code pain point: you set up a long overnight task with a detailed plan, go to sleep, and wake up to find it stopped 30 minutes in. This resonates with anyone running autonomous agents.

## Deep Analysis
This is a real operational challenge we face too. The agent stopping prematurely during overnight tasks wastes the entire sleep cycle. Solutions include:
- Better heartbeat/checkpoint systems
- Ralph loops with explicit continuation
- Watchdog processes that restart on stall
- Breaking large tasks into smaller autonomous units

## Why This Matters
- Directly relevant to our overnight build workflows
- Community validation that this is a universal problem
- May contain good solutions in the replies
