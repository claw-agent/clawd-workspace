## Summary
0xSero argues Claude is no longer best-in-class at any specific task. Claims Kimi-K2.5 beats it at computer/browser automation, and suggests other models have surpassed Claude in their respective niches. Only keeps Claude for Clawdbot (OpenClaw) where it's the native model.

## Deep Analysis
Interesting competitive landscape assessment. If Kimi-K2.5 is genuinely better at browser automation, that's relevant for our agent workflows. However, Claude's strength as the native OpenClaw model (deep tool integration, context management) may matter more than raw benchmark performance.

Worth tracking:
- Kimi-K2.5 for browser automation tasks
- Whether OpenClaw adds first-class Kimi support
- The "good enough generalist vs specialist" tradeoff

## Why This Matters
- Challenges our default model choice
- Kimi-K2.5 browser automation claim worth testing
- Model diversification strategy

## Action Items
- [ ] Test Kimi-K2.5 for browser automation tasks
- [ ] Compare with Claude for our specific workflows
