## Summary
Viral tweet about Shannon, an autonomous AI pentesting tool. It uses Claude Code architecture but focused on security testing - point it at a target and it autonomously attempts to find and exploit vulnerabilities. The poster demonstrated it extracting an entire database from a test application.

## Deep Analysis
Shannon is already installed in Marb's toolkit (documented in TOOLS.md at `~/clawd/tools/shannon/`). This tweet going viral validates the tool's capability and shows the broader community is discovering it. The autonomous pentesting space is heating up.

## Why This Matters
- Shannon is already in our toolkit - confirms we're ahead of the curve
- Security testing automation is a growing market
- Could be relevant for XPERIENCE or other business security audits

## Action Items
- [ ] Verify Shannon is up to date with latest version
- [ ] Consider running it against XPERIENCE properties for security audit
