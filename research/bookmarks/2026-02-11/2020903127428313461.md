## The Tweet
> Chrome 146 includes an early preview of WebMCP, accessible via a flag, that lets AI agents query and execute services without browsing the web app like a user.
>
> Services can be declared through an imp[ort map/manifest]

## Summary
Google is building MCP (Model Context Protocol) directly into Chrome. WebMCP allows AI agents to interact with web services programmatically instead of through UI automation (clicking, scrolling, etc.). Services declare their capabilities and agents can directly query/execute them.

## Deep Analysis
This is HUGE for the agent ecosystem. Currently, browser automation (Playwright, Puppeteer, browser-use) is brittle and slow because agents have to navigate UIs like humans. WebMCP means websites can expose structured APIs that agents consume natively. This is like the jump from screen-scraping to REST APIs.

Key implications:
- Browser-use tools may become less necessary for supported sites
- Websites will compete to have the best agent-accessible interfaces
- MCP becomes a web standard, not just a Claude-specific protocol
- Early Chrome 146 flag = production in ~3-4 months

## Why This Matters
- Directly impacts our browser automation stack (browser-use, agent-browser, stealth-browse)
- Future agent workflows will be WebMCP-first, browser fallback
- Early adoption opportunity for building WebMCP-compatible services

## Action Items
- [ ] Monitor Chrome 146 release timeline
- [ ] Explore WebMCP spec and early documentation
- [ ] Consider how XPERIENCE services could expose WebMCP endpoints
