## 1. @PJaccetturo — "Everyone is using Seedance 2.0 wrong"

**Source:** https://x.com/PJaccetturo/status/2021364684679676078
**Engagement:** 1,123 likes, 120 RTs, 136 replies

### Summary
PJ Ace (AI filmmaker, Grok Game Day contest winner, runs an AI ad agency) argues that Seedance 2.0 making cinematic video generation "easy" is actually a **problem** — because if anyone can do it in one prompt, there's no defensibility and no career.

### Key Arguments
1. **"The New Law of AI Physics"**: More inputs you put in → more inbound demand you get. If there's no "you" in the work, it's slop.
2. **The 99.9% Problem**: Most viral Sora creators never translated views into actual work because clients realized anyone could replicate it.
3. **Two Pivots:**
   - **Branded work** — AI commercials/brand deals are easy money right now
   - **Narrative storytelling** — 2-3 minute episodic sequences with character progression (weekly), not 30-min films
4. **Adaptation Strategy**: Find popular-but-not-too-popular books/video games, make AI adaptations, then pitch the IP holders
5. **The Self-Test**: Before posting, ask "Could anyone else make this but me?"

### Practical Seedance Tips (Extracted)
- Seedance 2.0 can one-shot action/anime scenes with minimal prompting
- The tool is so good that **differentiation comes from workflow, not prompting**
- Don't just "yolo a prompt and post it"
- Build IP/universe over time (weekly episodic content)

### Comparison vs Our Playbook
Our playbook at `~/clawd/research/ai-video-gen-playbook.md` already covers:
- ✅ Short prompts work better on Seedance (Mistake #1)
- ✅ Multi-model workflows
- ✅ Post-production importance

**What we're MISSING:**
- ❌ **The business strategy layer** — Our playbook is technical only. PJ's insight about defensibility and career building is absent
- ❌ **Episodic/serial content strategy** — We focus on single clips, not building a universe/IP over time
- ❌ **Brand deal workflow** — How to monetize AI video through branded content
- ❌ **IP adaptation strategy** — Using AI films as pitch material for book/game IP holders
- ❌ **The "self-test" framework** — A quality gate beyond technical quality

### Actionable Takeaways
1. Add a "Business Strategy" section to the playbook
2. The Red Rising project fits PJ's "adaptation strategy" perfectly — make episodes, pitch Pierce Brown
3. For XPERIENCE: AI commercials for contractor businesses could be a service offering

**Source:** https://x.com/cboyack
**Handle:** @cboyack — "Connor Boyack 📚"

### Who He Is
Connor Boyack is a **libertarian author, activist, and media entrepreneur** based in Utah. He's the founder and president of the **Libertas Institute** (Utah-based free-market think tank) and creator of the **Tuttle Twins** — a massively successful children's book series that teaches economics, liberty, and free-market principles to kids. The series has sold millions of copies and was adapted into an animated TV show (@TuttleTwinsTv).

### Content Profile (from recent tweets, sorted by engagement)
His X feed is a **high-volume libertarian/conservative commentary machine**:

|-------|-------|
| 1,185 | "Education is a right!" No. You have the right to *pursue* education... |
| 905 | U.S. spends $16,000+ per student... It's not a funding problem. It's a monopoly problem. |
| 848 | Parental authority predates government. Your kids aren't on loan from the state. |
| 292 | Central planning fails because planners can't know what millions want. |
| 263 | The state promises security in exchange for freedom. History shows you get neither. |
| 177 | Every dollar taken by force is a dollar that can't be invested... |
| 165 | The state doesn't educate. It trains. |
| 128 | Socialism's promise: Equality. Socialism's delivery: Equally poor. |

### Content Themes
- **Anti-public education / pro school choice** (his biggest engagement driver)
- **Free market economics** (Austrian school style aphorisms)

## 3. @WillManidis — "Tool Shaped Objects" Essay

**Source:** https://x.com/WillManidis/status/2021655191901155534
**Engagement:** 9,016 likes, 1,082 RTs, 346 replies (MASSIVE)

### Who Is Will Manidis
CEO of a company (unclear which from tweets), prolific essayist on X. Called "on a G.O.O.D. Fridays-level run" by investors. Tim O'Reilly retweeted him. Yohei Nakajima (BabyAGI creator) quoted him.

### The Core Argument

Will introduces the concept of a **"Tool Shaped Object" (TSO)** — something that looks like a tool, feels like a tool, produces the *sensation* of work... but doesn't actually produce work. **Its function IS to feel like a tool.**

**The Kanna Analogy:** A $3,000 Japanese hand plane that takes days to set up and produces transcendent wood shavings — but a power planer does the same work in seconds. The setup IS the practice. The shavings ARE the product.

### Key Arguments

1. **"The market for feeling productive is orders of magnitude larger than the market for being productive."** — This is the essay's most-quoted line.

2. **FarmVille as paradigm**: Click anywhere, number goes up. The direction doesn't matter. The screen fills with evidence of effort. This is the entire product.

3. **The AI boom is the most sophisticated TSO ever created:**
   - We talk about token budgets, GPU clusters, trillion-dollar buildouts
   - "AI is everywhere in consumption and almost nowhere in output"
   - Teams build agent systems of "breathtaking complexity whose primary output is the existence of the system itself"
   - Agents produce logs → logs analyzed by other agents → reports generated → dashboards populated → the apparatus hums with "the unmistakable energy of work being done" → **what is being done is the operation of the apparatus**

4. **The token budget illusion**: Miles Grimshaw's "token budget" concept treats token consumption like capex — more tokens = more output. Will argues the relationship between tokens consumed and value produced is "in most cases, a cloud" not a line.

5. **Why LLMs are uniquely dangerous as TSOs**: Prior TSOs were constrained by medium (FarmVille → sensation of farming, Notion → sensation of organizing). **An LLM can produce the sensation of anything.** 

6. **The gradient problem**: LLMs ARE genuine tools sometimes. The line between tool and TSO isn't a line but a gradient. "You can only fail to notice when you have crossed from one side to the other."

7. **The prescription**: "Ask what the number is before making it go up."

### How This Applies to AI Tool Evaluation

This is a **critical framework** for evaluating any AI tool or workflow:

| Question | TSO Indicator |
|----------|--------------|
| What measurable output does this produce? | If you can't name it → TSO |
| Could I achieve the same result without this tool? | If yes with less effort → TSO |
| Am I configuring/tuning more than producing? | Setup-as-practice → TSO |
| Does using this tool make me FEEL productive? | Feeling ≠ being → check |
| What would happen if I stopped using this? | If nothing changes → TSO |

### Actionable Takeaways
1. **Apply TSO test to our own stack**: Are any of our agent systems, QMD collections, or MCP servers producing "the operation of the apparatus" rather than output?
2. **For XPERIENCE consulting**: This framework is gold for evaluating AI tools for contractors. "Does this AI scheduling system actually book more jobs, or does it just feel like it does?"
3. **For content**: This essay's framing could be adapted into consulting material
4. **Self-check**: When building agent workflows, always start with "what is the output?" not "what can I build?"

## 4. #17 — 3D Staging for Landscaping (XPERIENCE Application)

### The Original Tweet
**Source:** https://x.com/mountain_mal/status/2021675372639821830
**Author:** Martin Maly (@mountain_mal) — founder of Teleport (360° panorama iPhone app)
**Engagement:** 9,435 likes, 783 RTs

### The Pipeline
1. **Capture** 16 ultra-wide photos with iPhone (using Teleport app)
2. **Stitch** into a 360° equirectangular panorama
3. **Feed into NanoBanana** (AI image gen) with a staging prompt → generates a newly staged 360° image
4. **Reconstruct into 3D** using World Labs' Marble → fully navigable 3D walkthrough

Quote: "you're not just staging photos anymore — you're staging space"

### The Tools
- **Teleport** (by @mountain_mal) — iPhone app for capturing 360° panoramas from 16 photos
- **NanoBanana** (nanobanana.com) — AI image generation, specifically referenced for 360° staging. Appears to handle equirectangular image editing
- **World Labs / Marble** (worldlabs.ai / marble.worldlabs.ai) — Fei-Fei Li's "spatial intelligence" company. Marble generates navigable 3D worlds from text, images, videos, or **360 panoramas**. Supports multimodal input, interactive editing, and various 3D export formats. This is the key 3D reconstruction piece.

### Could This Work for LANDSCAPING?

**YES — and it could be a killer differentiator for contractors.** Here's why:

**The Landscaping Use Case:**
1. Contractor takes 16 photos of a client's yard with iPhone
2. Stitches into 360° panorama (Teleport app)
3. AI generates a landscaped version of the panorama (new plants, hardscape, lighting, etc.)
4. Reconstructs into a 3D walkthrough the client can explore
5. Client sees their yard transformed BEFORE any work begins

**Why this is powerful for contractors:**
- Interior virtual staging is already a $500M+ industry in real estate
- **Nobody is doing this for exteriors/landscaping** (that I can find)
- A contractor who can show a 3D walkthrough of a completed landscape project closes more deals
- Eliminates "imagination gap" — clients can't visualize what their yard COULD look like
- Could charge premium for "design visualization" as an add-on service

### Existing AI Landscaping Tools (Research)

| Tool | What It Does | Limitation |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **iScape** | AR landscaping overlay on phone camera | Simple plant placement, not photorealistic |
| **PRO Landscape** | Professional landscape design software | Traditional CAD-style, not AI-generated |
| **Planner 5D** | 3D home/garden design | Manual placement, no AI from photos |
| **Yard.ai** (if it exists) | AI landscape suggestions | Haven't confirmed availability |
| **Generic AI image gen** (Midjourney, DALL-E) | Can reimagine a yard photo | 2D only, no 3D walkthrough |

**The gap**: Nobody has assembled the full pipeline (photo → 360° pano → AI restaging → 3D walkthrough) for landscaping specifically.

### The XPERIENCE Opportunity

**Build the pipeline as a service:**
1. Train a contractor (or do it for them) to capture 16 photos of a client's yard
2. Use Teleport → NanoBanana → World Labs Marble pipeline
3. Generate 3D walkthrough showing proposed landscaping
4. Present to client during sales consultation
5. **Close rate goes through the roof**

**API Availability:**
- World Labs Marble has an API (Martin Maly mentions using it)
- NanoBanana — unclear if API exists, but it's used programmatically in the demo
- This could potentially be automated into a self-service tool

### Actionable Takeaways
1. **Test the pipeline**: Take 16 photos of a yard, run through Teleport → NanoBanana → Marble
2. **Validate with XPERIENCE contractors**: Would they pay for a "landscape visualization" service?
3. **First-mover advantage**: Nobody is doing this for outdoor/landscaping yet
4. **Could also work for**: roofing visualizations (show different materials), exterior painting, hardscaping, pool installations
5. **Check Marble API pricing** at marble.worldlabs.ai

## 5. @crystalsssup — Kimi K2.5 McKinsey-Grade Consulting Slides

**Source:** https://x.com/crystalsssup/status/2021128641917354475
**Engagement:** 3,311 likes, 412 RTs
**Also:** Earlier version: https://x.com/crystalsssup/status/2014264867423940846 (3,237 likes)

### The Exact Prompt

Crystal (@crystalsssup) uses Kimi's slide feature (coding/adaptive mode, NOT image gen). Here is the **full prompt template**:

```
[YOUR ANALYSIS REQUEST HERE - e.g., "Conduct a comprehensive analysis of the GenAI video model market, focusing on leading players (e.g., Seedance 2.0, Sora, Kling, Veo, Luma). Compare their core architectures, temporal consistency, and prompt adherence to identify current industry benchmarks. Use the latest information"]

Requirement:
A professional, high-density consulting presentation slide, designed in the style of a top-tier strategy firm (McKinsey/BCG) blended with high-end editorial aesthetics.

Core Content & Layout:
1. Rich Data Visualization: The slide is populated with complex, precise charts (stacked bar charts, waterfall charts, or line graphs) and detailed data tables with rows and columns.
2. Structured Frameworks: Includes strategic diagrams or 2x2 matrices constructed with thin, clean lines.
3. High Information Density: The layout is sophisticated and multi-column, mimicking an actual business analysis deck, not just an empty cover page.

Visual Style:
1. Aesthetic: Tech-minimalist but information-heavy. Clean, sharp, and authoritative.
2. Typography: Serif fonts (like Times New Roman) for the main headlines to give a premium financial report feel; clean Sans-serif for chart labels and data numbers.
3. Color Palette: Clean white background. Text is sharp black. Charts and graphical accents use Deep Royal Blue and distinct shades of grey for data hierarchy.
4. Graphics: Use fine hairline borders for tables and precise vector lines for graphs.
```

### The Technique (Transferable to Claude)

The power isn't Kimi-specific. The technique is:

1. **Separate content from presentation** — Analysis request THEN visual specification
2. **Reference a specific authority style** — "McKinsey/BCG" anchors the model's output to a known standard
3. **Extremely specific visual constraints** — Font families, color palettes, line weights
4. **"Information density" framing** — Telling the model the output should look like a REAL consulting slide, not a cover page
5. **Multi-format output** — Charts, tables, matrices, and text all in one deliverable

### Replicating with Claude

Claude can't generate slides visually, but we CAN:

1. **Use Claude to generate the content + structure** in markdown, then render with Typst/HTML
2. **Use Claude's artifact/code mode** to generate HTML slides with the exact visual spec
3. **Prompt Claude with the same framework** but ask for HTML output:

```
Conduct a comprehensive analysis of [TOPIC].

Output as a single self-contained HTML page styled as a McKinsey/BCG consulting slide:
- Multi-column layout with charts (use Chart.js or inline SVG)
- Stacked bar charts, waterfall charts, 2x2 matrices
- Typography: Times New Roman headlines, system sans-serif for data
- Colors: white background, black text, Deep Royal Blue (#1B3A6B) accents, grey hierarchy
- Hairline table borders, precise vector lines
- High information density — this should look like a real consulting deck page, not a cover slide
```

Then render to PDF with WeasyPrint or screenshot.

### Actionable Takeaways
1. Save this prompt template to `~/clawd/templates/mckinsey-slide-prompt.md`
2. Test with Claude Opus generating HTML → WeasyPrint → PDF
3. For XPERIENCE proposals: Use this technique to make contractor market analysis look premium
4. The visual specification section is reusable for any "make it look professional" task

## 6. @eyad_khrais — Claude Code 101 (Complete Tutorial)

**Source:** https://x.com/eyad_khrais/status/2010076957938188661
**Engagement:** 18,974 likes, 2,168 RTs, 271 replies
**Author:** Eyad — 7yr SWE (Amazon, Disney, Capital One), now CTO of a startup building enterprise agents. Claude Code daily driver.

### Key Insights (Full Breakdown)

#### 1. Think First (Plan Mode)
- **Shift+Tab twice** → Plan mode
- "10 out of 10 times, plan mode output was significantly better"
- If you lack experience, use a separate ChatGPT/Gemini/Claude conversation to design the architecture FIRST, then give Claude Code the plan
- Think applies even to small tasks like email summarization

#### 2. CLAUDE.md Best Practices
- **Keep it short** — Claude reliably follows ~150-200 instructions; system prompt uses ~50. Every instruction competes for attention
- **Be project-specific** — Don't explain what "components" is. Tell it the weird stuff
- **Tell it WHY** — "Use TypeScript strict mode because we've had production bugs from implicit any types" > "Use TypeScript strict mode"
- **Update constantly** — Press `#` to auto-add instructions. If you correct Claude twice on the same thing, add it to CLAUDE.md
- **Good CLAUDE.md = "notes you'd leave yourself if you knew you'd have amnesia tomorrow"**

#### 3. Context Window Management
- **Quality degrades at 20-40%** context usage, not 100%
- **The copy-paste reset**: Copy important stuff → `/compact` → `/clear` → paste back only what matters
- **One conversation per task** — Don't mix auth refactoring with database work
- **External memory**: Write plans/progress to actual files (SCRATCHPAD.md, plan.md)
- `/clear` is better than not clearing, 9/10 times

#### 4. Prompting
- Specific > vague, always
- **Tell it what NOT to do** — "Claude 4.5 likes to overengineer"
- Give context about WHY — "this needs to be fast because it runs on every request"
- "If your output sucks, your input sucked. There's no way around this."

#### 5. Model Selection
- **Opus**: Complex reasoning, planning, architectural decisions
- **Sonnet**: Execution, boilerplate, refactoring where path is clear
- **Workflow**: Opus to plan → Sonnet to implement (Shift+Tab to switch)

#### 6. MCP, Hooks, Commands
- **MCP**: Connect to Slack, GitHub, databases. If you copy info from somewhere into Claude repeatedly, there's probably an MCP server for it
- **Hooks**: Auto-run code before/after changes (Prettier, type checking). Can set hooks to clean code every N lines
- **Custom slash commands**: `.claude/commands/` folder with markdown files → `/commandname`

#### 7. When Stuck
- **Don't loop** — If you've explained the same thing 3 times, change approach
- Clear the conversation
- Simplify the task (if stuck, your plan mode was insufficient)
- Show instead of tell — write a minimal example
- Reframe the problem

#### 8. Build Systems, Not One-Shots
- `-p` flag for headless mode — script it, pipe output, chain with bash
- Enterprises: auto PR reviews, support tickets, documentation updates
- **Flywheel**: Claude makes mistake → review logs → improve CLAUDE.md → Claude gets better
- "If you're only using Claude interactively, you're leaving value on the table"

### Relevance to Our Skills Restructuring (`~/clawd/skills/`)

**Direct applications:**

1. **Our AGENTS.md IS the CLAUDE.md** — Eyad's advice validates our approach but suggests:
   - Keep it shorter (we may be too long)
   - More "why" explanations, less "what" documentation
   - The "amnesia tomorrow" test: would our files make sense to a fresh session?

2. **Skills should include WHY, not just HOW** — Each skill file should explain the reasoning behind its approach, not just steps

3. **External memory pattern**: Our `memory/context/active.md` + daily notes already do this. Validated.

4. **Hook-based quality gates**: We could add hooks to auto-lint, auto-test after Claude edits

5. **The copy-paste reset technique**: We should document this as a standard recovery procedure

6. **Headless mode for automation**: Our subagent pattern already does this. Could extend to scheduled tasks via `-p` flag

### What We Can Learn About Structuring Skills

| Eyad's Principle | Our Skill Structure Implication |
|-----------------|-------------------------------|
| Short, specific CLAUDE.md | Each skill file should be <200 lines |
| Tell WHY not just WHAT | Add "## Why This Approach" section to skills |
| Update constantly | Skills should have "last validated" dates |
| One task per conversation | Skills should be atomic — one capability each |
| External memory files | Skills can reference scratchpad patterns |
| Plan before execute | Skills should include a "## Planning Checklist" |

### Actionable Takeaways
1. Audit AGENTS.md length — may need trimming per Eyad's 150-200 instruction limit
2. Add WHY sections to all skill files
3. Document the copy-paste reset as standard procedure
4. Test hooks for auto-linting after edits
5. Consider headless `-p` mode for scheduled research tasks
6. Save this as reference at `~/clawd/skills/claude-code-best-practices.md`
