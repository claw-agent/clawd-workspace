# AI Business Models & The "Software > Everything" Thesis

**Research Date:** January 24, 2026  
**Source:** @davidondrej1's thesis on software-first businesses

---

## Executive Summary

The core thesis: **Software businesses are uniquely positioned for the AI era** because they:
1. Have near-zero marginal cost
2. Scale without linear headcount
3. Generate recurring revenue
4. Can be built and operated solo or with tiny teams
5. Are highly sellable (liquid assets)

AI tools (Claude, Cursor, Bolt, Replit) have collapsed the time-to-build from months → hours, making this the best era in history to bootstrap software companies.

## 📊 The 4 Failure Factors Framework

When choosing a business model, avoid these 4 common failure modes:

### 1. ⏰ No Time Freedom
**Problem:** Businesses that trade time for money (consulting, agencies, services)
**Solution:** Software products with recurring revenue, not hourly billing

### 2. 💰 No Recurring Revenue
**Problem:** One-time sales require constant customer acquisition
**Solution:** SaaS with monthly/annual subscriptions, high LTV

### 3. 🚪 No Exit Potential
**Problem:** Businesses that can't be sold (personal brands, key-person dependent)
**Solution:** Productized software with documented systems, transferable assets

### 4. 🤖 Not Future-Proof
**Problem:** Businesses that AI will commoditize
**Solution:** Build WITH AI, not against it. Use AI as leverage, not competitor

**The Perfect Business:**
✅ Time-free (passive/semi-passive income)
✅ Recurring revenue (SaaS, subscriptions)
✅ Sellable (documented, transferable)
✅ AI-native (built with and for the AI era)

## 🎨 Vibe Coding / AI-First Development

### What is Vibe Coding?
Term coined by Andrej Karpathy (former Tesla AI lead, OpenAI):

> "It's wild... I hate vibe coding. I love Cursor tab coding." — ThePrimeagen

**The concept:** Using AI assistants (Cursor, Claude, Copilot) to code by describing what you want rather than typing syntax. The AI handles implementation; you handle intent.

### The Autonomy Slider (Karpathy's Framework)
Different levels of AI assistance:
1. **Tab completion** — AI autocompletes your code
2. **Cmd+K edits** — Targeted AI modifications
3. **Full agentic** — AI writes entire features autonomously

### Key Tools for Vibe Coding

| Tool | Description | Pricing |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Cursor** | AI-native code editor, VSCode fork | $20/month |
| **Bolt.new** | Full-stack AI builder in browser | Usage-based |
| **Replit** | AI coding + instant deployment | Freemium |
| **Claude** | General-purpose AI (via API or chat) | Usage-based |
| **v0.dev** | AI UI component generator (Vercel) | Freemium |

### Cursor Adoption Stats
- "Millions of professional developers" (per homepage)
- Stripe: "hundreds to thousands" of employees using it
- YC: "Over 80% adoption... spread like wildfire"

### Replit Success Stories
- **Spellbook:** Built prototype in 2 weeks that "completely changed trajectory"
- **Batchdata:** "Developer would take a week... I did it in an hour"

**Lesson:** Vibe coding is the new normal. Developers who resist will be outpaced by those who embrace AI as a multiplier.
