# City Landing Page Template

**Purpose:** Create "[City] Roofing" pages to rank for local searches
**Target:** One page per major service area city

## Why City Pages Matter

When someone searches "roofing Sandy Utah" or "roof repair West Jordan," Google looks for pages that specifically mention those cities. Without city pages, you're invisible for these searches.

Competitors like American Roofing and Vertex have city pages. You don't. Let's fix that.

## Implementation Notes

1. **Don't duplicate content** — Each page needs unique local details
2. **Add local landmarks/neighborhoods** — Shows Google you actually know the area
3. **Use city name 3-5 times** — In headline, body, and CTA
4. **Add photos** — Local job sites in each city if available
5. **Internal links** — Link from city pages to service pages and vice versa

---

## Example: Sandy Page

**URL:** `/roofing-sandy`

**Hero:** "Trusted Roofing in Sandy, Utah"

**Local Detail:** "From the neighborhoods near Dimple Dell to homes along 9400 South, we've helped Sandy families protect their biggest investment.
