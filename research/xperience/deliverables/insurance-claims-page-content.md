## Section 1: The Problem

### Headline
**Insurance Claims Are Complicated. We Make Them Simple.**

### Body Copy
When a storm damages your roof, you're suddenly dealing with:
- Documenting damage before it gets worse
- Filing claims with tight deadlines
- Negotiating with adjusters who want to minimize payouts
- Finding a contractor you can actually trust
- Coordinating repairs while protecting your home

**You shouldn't have to become an insurance expert overnight.**

That's why XPERIENCE handles the entire process. From the first inspection to the final repair, we're with you every step.

## Section 2: Our Process

### Headline
**How We Handle Your Insurance Claim**

### Step 1: Free Inspection (Same-Day Available)
We inspect your roof within 24 hours of your call — often the same day. Our team documents every detail: photos, measurements, damage notes. This documentation is critical for getting your claim approved.

### Step 2: Detailed Report & Estimate
You'll receive a comprehensive damage report with:
- Itemized list of all damage found
- Professional photos and annotations
- Accurate repair/replacement estimate
- Manufacturer specifications (what your insurance needs)

### Step 3: We File With You
We help you file your claim correctly the first time. No missing information. No rejected claims. We know exactly what insurance companies need to see.

### Step 4: Adjuster Meeting
When your insurance adjuster comes out, we meet them at your property. We walk them through every damage point. We advocate for you to get the full repair value you're entitled to.

### Step 5: Approval & Repair
Once your claim is approved, we handle the rest:
- Schedule repairs around your timeline
- Order materials
- Complete work to manufacturer specs
- Final walkthrough to ensure you're satisfied

### Step 6: Warranty & Peace of Mind
Every repair comes with our **15-year workmanship warranty**. We're here long after the insurance check clears.

## Section 4: Common Questions

### FAQ Content

**Q: How do I know if my roof has storm damage?**
A: Look for missing shingles, dents in gutters/vents, granules in downspouts, or water stains inside. But honestly — just call us. Our inspection is free, and we'll tell you exactly what we find (even if it's nothing).

**Q: Will filing a claim raise my insurance rates?**
A: In Utah, insurance companies cannot raise your rates for weather-related claims. This is damage you didn't cause — you paid for coverage, so use it.

**Q: What if my insurance denies my claim?**
A: We help you appeal. Our documentation is thorough enough that denials are rare, but if it happens, we'll work with you to fight it.

**Q: How long do I have to file a claim?**
A: Most policies require claims within 1 year of the damage, but sooner is always better. Damage can worsen, and documentation is clearer when it's fresh.

**Q: Do you work with all insurance companies?**
A: Yes. We've worked with State Farm, Allstate, Progressive, Farmers, USAA, and every major carrier in Utah. We know their processes.

**Q: What does "no upfront cost" mean?**
A: For insurance-covered repairs, you typically only pay your deductible. The rest is covered. We'll explain exactly what to expect before any work begins.
