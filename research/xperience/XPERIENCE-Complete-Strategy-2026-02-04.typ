= Executive Summary

XPERIENCE Roofing is positioned for significant growth. With 20+ years of industry experience, a 4.9-star Google rating, 12,000+ roofs installed, and operations across 10+ states, the foundation is strong.

This document combines:
1. *Comprehensive marketing strategy* — social media, content, SEO, paid ads
2. *Automated lead generation system* — targeting homeowners with aging roofs using public data

== Key Opportunity

Utah has one of the best public parcel databases in the country. We can target homeowners with 15+ year old roofs, enrich with contact info, and run compliant outreach campaigns — all automated.

*Cost estimate:* Around 300-500 per month for 1,000 targeted leads (vs. 150+ per lead industry average)

  ```
]

*Available data:*

= Appendix: Pitch Points for Thursday

== The Big Ideas

1. *"We can target homes by age"*
   - 15+ year old roofs are prime replacement candidates
   - Public data lets us find them automatically

2. *"Data is free"*
   - Utah has one of the best public parcel databases in the country
   - Zero cost for targeting data

3. *"Replaces door-to-door"*
   - More efficient, scalable, less overhead
   - Same targeting precision, better coverage

4. *"Compliance built-in"*
   - Email-first strategy avoids TCPA issues
   - All outreach follows CAN-SPAM guidelines

5. *"Optional roof analysis"*
   - Can add aerial inspection for highest-value targets
   - AI damage detection prioritizes hot leads

== Investment Required

- *Minimal:* 300-500/month for 1,000 targeted leads
- *Standard:* 3,500-7,000/month including paid ads
- *Premium:* Add aerial analysis for 50-100 per high-value roof

== Expected ROI

At 50-100 cost per lead vs. industry average 150+:
- *50% reduction in lead acquisition cost*
- *Higher quality leads* (targeting by roof age)
- *Scalable system* (not dependent on door-knockers)
