## 1. Google Business Profile Optimization

Google Business Profile (GBP) is the #1 factor for appearing in the local 3-pack—the map listings that appear at the top of local search results. For roofing companies, this is where 70%+ of leads originate.

### 1.1 Essential Profile Setup

**Complete Every Field:**
- **Business Name:** Exact legal name (no keyword stuffing—Google penalizes this)
- **Primary Category:** "Roofing Contractor" (most important ranking factor)
- **Secondary Categories:** Add all relevant ones:
  - Roof repair service
  - Gutter installation service
  - Siding contractor
  - Storm damage restoration
- **Address:** Full verified address (must match all citations)
- **Phone:** Local number preferred over 800 numbers
- **Website:** Link to optimized landing page, not just homepage
- **Hours:** Accurate hours including holiday hours
- **Service Areas:** Define your radius (typically 25-50 miles for roofers)

### 1.2 GBP Ranking Factors (Ranked by Impact)

| Factor | Impact Level | Action |
|--------|--------------|--------|
| Proximity to searcher | High | Can't control—focus on service area accuracy |
| Reviews (quantity + quality) | High | Active review generation campaign |
| Category selection | High | Right primary + relevant secondaries |
| Complete business info | Medium-High | 100% profile completion |
| Photos/Videos | Medium | 20+ photos, updated monthly |
| Posts | Medium | Weekly posts with CTAs |
| Q&A section | Low-Medium | Seed with common questions |

### 1.3 Photo Strategy

**Minimum 20 photos across these categories:**
- Logo (primary photo)
- Cover photo (crew or completed project)
- 5+ Before/After project photos
- Team photos (builds trust)
- Equipment/truck photos (professionalism)
- Certifications (GAF, Owens Corning, etc.)
- Office/showroom (if applicable)

**Photo Tips:**
- Geotag all photos with location metadata
- Use descriptive file names: "roof-replacement-denver-colorado.jpg"
- Add new photos weekly (signals active business)
- Videos get 2x engagement—add project walkthroughs

### 1.4 GBP Posts

Post weekly using this rotation:

| Week | Post Type | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|
| 1 | Project Showcase | "Just completed this 3,500 sq ft roof in [City]—Class 4 impact-resistant shingles" |
| 2 | Offer/Promotion | "Free storm damage inspection—schedule this week" |
| 3 | Educational | "5 Signs Your Roof Needs Replacement Before Winter" |
| 4 | Update/News | "Now GAF Master Elite certified—only 2% of contractors qualify" |

**Post Best Practices:**
- Include a CTA button (Call Now, Learn More, Get Quote)
- 150-300 words optimal
- Include 1 high-quality image
- Use local keywords naturally
- Posts expire after 7 days—consistency matters

### 1.5 Q&A Section

Seed your own Q&A with common customer questions:

1. "What areas do you serve?" → List all cities
2. "Do you offer financing?" → Explain options
3. "Are you insured and licensed?" → Confirm with details
4. "How long does a roof replacement take?" → Typical timeline
5. "Do you handle insurance claims?" → Process explanation
6. "What brands do you install?" → GAF, Owens Corning, etc.
7. "Can you repair a leaking roof today?" → Emergency response policy

### 1.6 GBP Services & Products

Add detailed service descriptions:

```
Service: Roof Replacement
Description: Complete tear-off and installation of new roofing systems. 
We install asphalt shingles, metal roofing, and flat roof systems. 
Serving [City] and surrounding areas with 25-year warranties.

## 2. Review Generation Strategies

**Why Reviews Matter for Roofers:**
- 93% of consumers read reviews before hiring a contractor
- Businesses with 4.5+ stars get 28% more clicks
- Review velocity (new reviews over time) impacts ranking
- Reviews with keywords ("roof replacement," "storm damage") boost relevance

### 2.1 Review Generation System

**Step 1: Create Your Review Link**

Generate a direct review link:
1. Search your business on Google
2. Click "Write a review" and copy the URL
3. Or use: `https://search.google.com/local/writereview?placeid=YOUR_PLACE_ID`

Use Whitespark's free Google Review Link Generator to create a short link.

**Step 2: Timing the Ask**

Best moments to request reviews:
1. **Immediately after job completion** (while they're happy)
2. **When customer expresses satisfaction** ("I love how it looks!")
3. **After final walkthrough** (face-to-face ask is most effective)
4. **24-48 hours post-completion** (follow-up text/email)

**Step 3: Multi-Channel Request System**

```
Workflow:
1. Crew foreman: Verbal ask at job completion
2. Office: Same-day text with review link
3. Office: 48-hour email reminder
4. Office: 7-day personal follow-up call (if no review)
```

### 2.2 Review Request Templates

**Text Message (Best Performer):**
```
Hi [Name]! Thanks for choosing [Company] for your roof. 
We'd really appreciate a quick Google review—it helps 
families like yours find trusted roofers.

[SHORT REVIEW LINK]

Thanks again! - [Your Name]
```

**Email Template:**
```
Subject: Quick favor, [Name]?

Hi [First Name],

It was a pleasure working on your roof at [Address]. 
We hope you're happy with the results!

If you have 60 seconds, we'd be grateful for a Google review. 
It helps other homeowners find quality roofing services.

[BUTTON: Leave a Review]

If anything isn't perfect, please call me directly at [phone] 
so we can make it right.

Thanks for trusting us with your home!

[Signature]
```

### 2.3 Employee Incentive Program

Incentivize your team to collect reviews:

| Metric | Bonus |
|--------|-------|
| Review mentions employee by name | $20 per review |
| 5-star review collected | $10 per review |
| Most reviews in a month | $100 bonus |
| Hitting team review goal | Team lunch/outing |

### 2.4 Review Response Strategy

**Respond to ALL reviews within 24-48 hours**

**Positive Review Response Template:**
```
Thank you so much, [Name]! Our team takes pride in every roof 
we install, and it means the world to hear you're happy with 
the work. We appreciate you trusting [Company Name] with your 
[City] home. If you ever need anything, we're just a call away!

- [Owner Name], Owner
```

**Negative Review Response Template:**
```
[Name], thank you for sharing your feedback. We're sorry your 
experience didn't meet your expectations. At [Company], customer 
satisfaction is our top priority.

I'd like to personally discuss this with you and make it right. 
Please call me directly at [phone] or email [email].

- [Owner Name], Owner
```

**Never:**
- Argue or get defensive
- Reveal customer details
- Offer compensation publicly (do this privately)
- Ignore negative reviews

### 2.5 Review Diversification

Don't put all eggs in Google's basket:

| Platform | Priority | Why |
|----------|----------|-----|
| Google | #1 | Local pack ranking |
| Facebook | #2 | Social proof + remarketing |
| Yelp | #3 | Some markets (varies by city) |
| BBB | #4 | Trust signal for older demographics |
| HomeAdvisor/Angi | #5 | If you use their leads |
| Houzz | #6 | Premium renovations |
| Nextdoor | #7 | Neighborhood trust |

### 2.6 Photo Reviews

Reviews with photos get 10x more attention. Ask satisfied customers:
> "Would you mind including a photo of the finished roof in your review? It really helps other homeowners see our work."

## 4. Citation Building

Citations are mentions of your business NAP (Name, Address, Phone) across the web. They're a key local ranking factor.

```

❌ Inconsistent (will hurt rankings):
```
ABC Roofing Co.          (abbreviated)
123 Main St #100         (different format)
Denver, Colorado 80202   (spelled out state)

### 6.4 Mobile Optimization

- Licensed & Insured
- BBB Accredited (with rating)
- Manufacturer certifications (GAF, Owens Corning)
- Google/Yelp rating badge
- Years in business
- Number of projects completed

**Testimonial Best Practices:**
- Include full name and city: "John S., Aurora, CO"
- Photo of the customer (with permission)
- Photo of their completed project
- Specific details: "Replaced our 30-year-old roof in just 2 days"
- Video testimonials convert 2-3x higher than text

### 6.6 A/B Testing Priority

Test these elements in order of impact:

1. **Headline** (30-50% lift possible)
2. **CTA button text and color**
3. **Hero image**
4. **Form length**
5. **Social proof placement**
6. **Price/offer structure**

Run tests for minimum 2 weeks or 100+ conversions before declaring winner.

## 7. Call Tracking

### 7.1 Why Call Tracking Matters

For roofing companies:

- Organic visitor sees: (303) 555-0003
- All ring to your main line

**Tracking Numbers by Source:**

### 7.4 Key Call Metrics to Track

1. **Call Volume by Source:** Where are calls coming from?
2. **Answered vs. Missed Calls:** Target 90%+ answer rate
3. **Call Duration:** <60 sec usually = unqualified; 3-5 min = qualified lead
4. **Time to Answer:** Under 3 rings ideal
5. **Conversion Rate:** Calls → Appointments → Sold Jobs
6. **Cost Per Call by Source:** Google Ads call = $X, Facebook = $Y
7. **Call Recording Quality:** For training

### 7.5 Missed Call Recovery

Every missed call is a lost $10,000+ job.

**Missed Call Workflow:**
```
Call missed → Instant text: "Sorry we missed you! How can we help?"
           → Notification to office manager
           → Callback attempt within 5 minutes
           → 2nd attempt at 30 minutes
           → 3rd attempt at 2 hours
           → Email follow-up if no contact
```

**Reduce Missed Calls:**
- Use call queuing during peak times
- Route overflow to after-hours service
- Mobile app for owner/manager backup
- AI receptionist as fallback (Smith.ai, Ruby)

### 7.6 Call Scoring & Recording

**Automatic Call Scoring (AI-powered):**
Many platforms now offer AI that listens to calls and scores:
- Lead quality (1-5 scale)
- Customer sentiment
- Keywords mentioned ("insurance claim," "emergency")
- Appointment set (yes/no)

**Use Recordings For:**
- Sales training (review winning calls)
- Quality assurance (customer complaints)
- Objection handling (build FAQ from real questions)
