= Executive Summary

Xperience Roofing is positioned for significant growth. With 20+ years of industry experience, a 4.9-star Google rating, 12,000+ roofs installed, and operations across 10+ states, the foundation is strong. This comprehensive strategy will amplify these strengths through systematic digital marketing.

== Key Findings

*Market Reality:* The roofing industry requires a trust-first approach. Unlike impulse purchases, a roof is often the second-largest investment a homeowner makes. Marketing must build trust over time, not just generate immediate leads.

*What Top Companies Do:* Successful roofing companies (\$2M+ revenue) don't rely on one lead source. They build systems with 5+ channels firing simultaneously: SEO, Google Ads, Facebook Ads, jobsite marketing, door-knocking, and referral pipelines.

*The Opportunity:* Most roofing companies underinvest in video content, social media consistency, and systematic review generation. These represent significant competitive advantages.
