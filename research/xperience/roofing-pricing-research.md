## Insurance Pricing (Xactimate)

### What is Xactimate?
Industry-standard software used by insurance adjusters to estimate claim payouts. Prices are updated monthly by region based on local material and labor costs.

### Key Insight
**Insurance payouts often differ from retail quotes:**
- Insurance uses standardized Xactimate pricing
- Contractors may charge more (or less) than insurance approves
- The gap between Xactimate and retail = contractor profit or homeowner out-of-pocket

### Typical Xactimate Rates (Residential Shingle)
*Note: Xactimate publishes regional price lists - these are approximate national ranges*

| Line Item | Xactimate Range |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Remove roofing - per square | $25-$45 |
| 30-yr architectural shingle - per square | $85-$150 |
| Synthetic underlayment - per square | $15-$25 |
| Drip edge - per linear ft | $1.50-$3.00 |
| Ridge cap - per linear ft | $4-$8 |
| Starter strip - per linear ft | $2-$4 |
| Flashing - per piece | $15-$40 |
| Labor for shingle install - per square | $45-$85 |

### Insurance vs Retail Gap
- Insurance Xactimate total: ~$250-$400/square (all-in)
- Retail contractor quote: ~$375-$600/square (all-in)
- **Typical gap: 30-50% higher retail**

### Why This Matters for XPERIENCE
1. Lead scoring can estimate potential job value
2. Know if insurance claim vs cash pay (different sales approach)
3. Helps price competitively while maintaining margin
