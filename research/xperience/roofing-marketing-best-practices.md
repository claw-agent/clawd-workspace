## Executive Summary

The roofing industry's marketing landscape has evolved significantly. Success in 2024-2025 requires a multi-channel approach combining strong local SEO, strategic paid advertising, authentic social media presence, and consistent brand messaging. The most successful roofing companies aren't relying on a single lead source—they're building **marketing systems** with 5+ initiatives firing simultaneously.

**Key Insight:** Unlike direct-response businesses, roofing has long sales cycles. Homeowners aren't impulse buyers—a roof is often the second-largest purchase they'll ever make. Marketing must build trust over time, not just generate immediate leads.

## What Works in 2024-2025

### The Multi-Channel Marketing System

Top roofing companies (>$2M revenue) don't rely on just one lead source. They build systems with:

1. **SEO + Google Ads** (search-focused marketing)
2. **Facebook/Meta Ads** (targeted, well-qualified audiences)
3. **Branded jobsite marketing** (wraps, signs, Catch-All tarps)
4. **Door-knocking systems** around every job site
5. **Referral pipelines** with insurance agents and realtors
6. **Google Business Profile** (fully optimized)
7. **Review generation systems** (automated follow-ups)

### Key Statistics

- **70%** of service businesses are found online (Google)
- **78%** of people who search for something nearby on phones visit within a day
- **30%** of all mobile searches are related to location
- **28%** of nearby searches result in a purchase
- Customers are **70% more likely to visit** and **50% more likely to purchase** from businesses with complete Google Business Profiles

### The Trust-First Approach

> "For eight out of ten people, the biggest purchase they'll ever make is their home. The second biggest purchase they will ever make are the things they do to improve their home." — David Carroll, Dope Marketing CEO

**Implication:** Guerrilla marketing tactics that create urgency work less well in roofing than in other industries. Focus on **brand building** and **consistent messaging** across all platforms.

---

## Local SEO: The Foundation

Local SEO is **non-negotiable** for roofing companies. It's the highest-ROI marketing activity because it captures homeowners actively searching for roofing services.

### Google Business Profile (GBP) Optimization

**Priority: CRITICAL**

Your GBP is the foundation of local search. Google states that customers are:
- 70% more likely to visit businesses with complete profiles
- 50% more likely to consider purchasing

#### GBP Optimization Checklist:

- [ ] Verify business ownership (may require video of premises)
- [ ] Complete ALL profile fields
- [ ] Select specific business category (e.g., "Roofing Contractor" not just "Contractor")
- [ ] Set accurate business hours (update for holidays)
- [ ] Add service area radius
- [ ] List all services offered
- [ ] Add photos (job sites, team, before/after)
- [ ] Enable messaging
- [ ] Post regular Google Posts (weekly updates)
- [ ] Respond to ALL reviews (positive and negative)

#### Keywords in GBP:

Include keywords naturally in:
- Business description
- Services listed
- Google Posts
- Review responses (e.g., "Thank you for your feedback on our roof replacement service in [City]. We value your input!")

### NAP Consistency (Name, Address, Phone)

**Why It Matters:**
- Voice search relies on consistent NAP data
- AI search engines aggregate business data from multiple sources
- 63% of consumers say incorrect business details would stop them from using a local business

**Best Practice:**
- Use EXACT same format everywhere (e.g., "Street" vs "St." - pick one)
- Include NAP in crawlable HTML on your website (not just in images)
- Place NAP in website footer AND contact page

### Citations & Directories

Submit your business to:

**Data Aggregators (Priority):**
- Data Axle
- Localeze (Neustar)
- Foursquare

**Major Platforms:**
- Apple Maps
- Yelp
- Yellow Pages
- Bing Places
- Facebook Business

**Industry-Specific:**
- HomeAdvisor (be cautious - shared leads)
- Angi (formerly Angie's List)
- Thumbtack
- BBB (Better Business Bureau)
- Local Chamber of Commerce (valuable for local link)

### Local Keyword Research

**Service-Based Keywords to Target:**
- Roof repair [city]
- Roof replacement [city]
- Emergency roof repair [city]
- Storm damage roof repair [city]
- Metal roofing [city]
- Shingle roof replacement [city]
- Commercial roofing [city]
- Roof inspection [city]

**Long-Tail Opportunities:**
- "How much does a new roof cost in [city]"
- "Best roofing company near me"
- "Roofing contractor [neighborhood]"
- "Insurance claim roofing [city]"

### Local Link Building

**Strategies:**
- Chamber of Commerce membership (authoritative local link)
- Local business directories
- Supplier websites (if you're an authorized installer)
- Local news coverage (sponsor community events)
- Guest posts on local blogs
- Partnerships with complementary businesses (gutters, windows, siding)

## Paid Ads vs Organic

### The Verdict: Both Are Necessary

**Organic (SEO)** builds long-term assets. **Paid Ads** provide immediate lead flow. The best companies use both strategically.

### Google Ads

**Pros:**
- Immediate visibility
- Targets high-intent searches
- Trackable ROI
- Control over budget

**Best Practices:**
- Target service-specific keywords (not just "roofing")
- Create dedicated landing pages for each service
- Use ad extensions (call, location, sitelinks)
- Implement conversion tracking
- A/B test ad copy continuously

**Expected Metrics:**
- Cost per lead varies by market ($50-200+)
- Focus on REVENUE per campaign, not just lead volume

### Local Services Ads (LSA)

**Why They Matter:**
- Appear at the TOP of Google results (above regular ads)
- "Google Guaranteed" badge builds trust
- Pay per lead, not per click
- Integrated with Google Business Profile

**Requirements:**
- Business verification
- Background checks
- License verification
- Insurance verification

**Pro Tip:** Use ServiceTitan or similar software to integrate LSA bookings directly into your CRM for attribution tracking.

### Social Media Ads (Facebook/Instagram)

**Best For:**
- Brand awareness
- Retargeting website visitors
- Targeting homeowners by demographics/interests
- Showcasing before/after work

**Content Types That Work:**
- Before/after photos
- Time-lapse videos of installations
- Customer testimonial videos
- Educational content about roofing materials

**Targeting Options:**
- Homeowners in service area
- Income levels (proxy for home value)
- Recent movers
- Interest in home improvement

### Organic SEO

**Timeline:** 6-12 months for significant results

**Investment Areas:**
1. Website optimization (speed, mobile, content)
2. Content creation (blog posts, service pages)
3. Link building
4. Google Business Profile management
5. Review generation

**ROI Comparison:**
- SEO: Compounds over time. A blog post can generate leads for years.
- Paid: Immediate results, but stops when you stop paying.

**Recommendation:** Start with paid ads for cash flow while building organic presence.
