# Coffee Shop Optimization Audit
## Recommendations for Marb's 3 Coffee Shops

*Prepared: Feb 11, 2026 | Status: Draft for Marb's review*

> Marb owns/co-owns 3 coffee shops (family business). This audit covers the highest-impact optimization levers for independent multi-location coffee operations. **I don't have specifics about the shops yet** — this is a framework. Once Marb shares details (names, locations, current revenue, POS system, etc.), I can tailor recommendations.

---

## Executive Summary

Independent coffee shops typically operate at **2-9% net profit margins** (vs 15-25% for chains with scale advantages). The biggest levers, in order of impact:

1. **Menu engineering** — Margin optimization on what you already sell
2. **Labor scheduling** — The #1 controllable cost (35-45% of revenue)
3. **Waste reduction** — Coffee/food waste is silent margin killer
4. **Average ticket increase** — Upselling, add-ons, bundling
5. **Technology & automation** — POS optimization, mobile ordering, loyalty
6. **Multi-location synergies** — Bulk purchasing, shared prep, cross-staffing

## 1. Menu Engineering (Highest ROI, Lowest Cost)

### The Menu Matrix
Every item falls into one of four quadrants:

| | High Popularity | Low Popularity |
|---|---|---|
| **High Margin** | ⭐ Stars (promote heavily) | 🧩 Puzzles (reposition/rename) |
| **Low Margin** | 🐴 Workhorses (raise price or reduce cost) | 🐕 Dogs (cut or reimagine) |

### Action Items
- [ ] **Audit COGS per menu item** — Most shops don't know true cost per drink
  - Espresso drinks: Target 15-20% COGS (milk is the expensive part, not coffee)
  - Drip coffee: 5-10% COGS (highest margin item on menu)
  - Food items: Target 25-35% COGS
- [ ] **Identify your Stars** — These should be featured, photographed, and positioned at eye-level on menu boards
- [ ] **Fix Workhorses** — Popular but low-margin items (often large specialty drinks with lots of milk/syrup). Options:
  - Reduce size slightly (20oz → 16oz saves ~$0.30/drink in milk)
  - Adjust recipe (one less pump of syrup = $0.05-0.10 saved × hundreds/day)
  - Price increase ($0.25-0.50 on popular items rarely impacts volume)
- [ ] **Kill or fix Dogs** — Items that don't sell AND lose money. Every menu item adds complexity for baristas

### Quick Wins
- **Oat milk upcharge:** If not already charging $0.75-1.00 for alt milks, start. Oat milk costs ~$0.45/serving vs $0.15 for whole milk. Most customers won't blink
- **Seasonal specials at premium pricing:** Limited-time items command 15-25% premium and drive traffic
- **Size anchoring:** If you have 3 sizes, price the medium closest to the large. Customers "upgrade" to large thinking it's a deal — and large has the best margin per cup

### Coffee-Specific Margins
| Item | Typical COGS | Suggested Price | Margin |
|------|-------------|-----------------|--------|
| 12oz drip coffee | $0.15-0.25 | $3.00-3.50 | 90%+ |
| 16oz latte (whole milk) | $0.55-0.75 | $5.50-6.50 | 85-88% |
| 16oz latte (oat milk) | $0.85-1.05 | $6.50-7.50 | 84-86% |
| 16oz mocha | $0.80-1.00 | $6.50-7.00 | 85% |
| Pastry (wholesale) | $1.00-1.50 | $3.50-4.50 | 65-70% |
| Breakfast sandwich | $1.50-2.50 | $5.50-7.00 | 55-65% |

**Key insight:** Drip coffee is the most profitable thing you sell. It should be excellent, prominently featured, and never an afterthought.

## 2. Labor Optimization (Biggest Cost Center)

### Benchmarks
- **Target labor cost:** 30-35% of revenue (including payroll taxes & benefits)
- **If above 40%:** Urgent action needed
- **If below 25%:** Likely understaffed (hurting customer experience and speed)

### Scheduling Optimization
- [ ] **Analyze hourly sales data** from POS — most shops overstaffed during slow periods
- [ ] **Implement "flex shifts"** — Staff scheduled for peak, sent home when volume drops
- [ ] **Cross-train everyone** — Barista who can also do food prep = fewer bodies needed
- [ ] **Stagger start times** — Don't bring everyone in at open. Opener + 1, add staff as morning rush builds

### Peak Hour Analysis
Typical independent coffee shop traffic pattern:
```
6-7am:   ████░░░░░░ 30% capacity — 2 staff
7-9am:   ██████████ 100% peak   — 4-5 staff  
9-11am:  ███████░░░ 60%          — 3 staff
11am-2pm:████░░░░░░ 35% (lunch?) — 2-3 staff
2-5pm:   ███░░░░░░░ 25%          — 2 staff
5-close: ██░░░░░░░░ 15%          — 1-2 staff
```

**The morning rush (7-9am) is where you make or lose money.** Optimize speed-of-service here above all else.

### Speed-of-Service Math
- Average morning customer spends: $5.50-7.00
- Average wait tolerance: 3-5 minutes (beyond this, you lose future visits)
- Each additional drink/minute capacity during peak = ~$35-45/hour additional revenue
- **A $20/hr barista who makes 25 drinks/hour generates $150+/hour in revenue. That's 7.5x their cost.**

### Multi-Location Staffing Advantage
With 3 shops, you can:
- Share a "float" staff member who covers call-outs across locations
- Cross-schedule closers at one shop as openers at another (if geography allows)
- Centralize training to maintain consistency

---

## 3. Waste Reduction

### Coffee Waste
- [ ] **Track daily waste** — Weigh discarded brewed coffee at end of day
- [ ] **Batch brew smaller, more often** — Fresh coffee every 30 min vs 1 hour during slow periods
- [ ] **Cold brew from day-old beans** — Don't trash aging whole bean; cold brew is forgiving
- [ ] **Dial-in waste** — Track how many shots are pulled vs sold. Dialing in espresso grind should waste <5% of shots

### Food Waste
- [ ] **Par levels based on actual sales data** — Not gut feeling
- [ ] **Day-part markdown** — Pastries at 50% off after 2pm rather than trashing at close
- [ ] **Too Good To Go app** — Sell end-of-day bags for $3.99 (recoup cost on would-be waste)
- [ ] **Freeze-and-reheat protocol** — Some items (scones, muffins) freeze well overnight

### Milk Waste
Milk is the #2 ingredient cost (after labor). Common waste:
- Oversteaming (pouring out excess steamed milk): Train baristas to steam exact amounts
- Spoilage: First-in-first-out rotation, proper fridge temps (36-38°F)
- **Estimated savings from milk waste reduction alone: $200-400/month per location**

---

## 4. Average Ticket Increase

### Current Benchmark
- Typical independent coffee shop: **$5.50-7.00 average ticket**
- With food program: **$7.50-10.00**
- Target: **Increase by $1.00-1.50** (15-25% revenue lift with zero additional foot traffic)

### Tactics
- [ ] **"Would you like a pastry with that?"** — Simple verbal upsell at register. Even 10% conversion = significant
- [ ] **Combo/bundle pricing** — "Coffee + pastry for $7.99" (vs $9.00 separate). Increases food attachment rate
- [ ] **Loyalty program with spend tiers** — "Spend $50, get a free drink" encourages ordering more per visit
- [ ] **Retail beans** — 12oz bags at $16-18. Margins are 50-60% and customers buy monthly
- [ ] **Merchandise** — Branded mugs, tumblers. High margin, builds brand loyalty
- [ ] **Tip prompt optimization** — Digital tip prompts at 18%/20%/25% increase average tip by 15-20% (benefits staff retention)

---

## 5. Technology & Automation

### POS Optimization
- [ ] **Confirm current POS system** — Square, Toast, Lightspeed, Clover?
- [ ] **Ensure all items are tracked** — No "open item" charges (kills your data)
- [ ] **Use POS reporting** — Most shops use 10% of their POS capabilities
  - Product mix reports (what sells, what doesn't)
  - Hourly sales (optimize staffing)
  - Employee performance (drinks/hour)
  - Void/discount tracking (loss prevention)

### Mobile Ordering
- [ ] **Evaluate mobile order-ahead** — Square Online, Toast TakeOut, or dedicated app
  - Reduces line length (captures customers who'd skip long lines)
  - Increases order accuracy
  - Enables easy upselling (digital menu shows more options)
  - **Typical lift: 10-15% increase in morning rush revenue**

### Loyalty Program
- [ ] **Digital loyalty > punch cards** — Tracks customer behavior, enables targeted promos
  - Square Loyalty: $45/mo per location
  - Stamp Me: $25-60/mo
  - Custom solution: We could build one 👀
- [ ] **Key metric:** Loyalty customers visit 2-3x more frequently and spend 20% more per visit

### AI/Automation Opportunities
- **Inventory forecasting** — AI predicts next-day demand based on weather, day-of-week, events → reduces waste & stockouts
- **Dynamic scheduling** — Tools like 7shifts or Homebase optimize labor to sales forecast
- **Customer analytics** — Who are your top 100 customers? What do they order? When do they come?
- **Review monitoring** — Automated Google/Yelp review responses (we already have this tech from XPERIENCE)

## 6. Multi-Location Synergies

### Purchasing Power
- [ ] **Consolidated ordering** — 3 locations = 3x volume = better pricing
  - Coffee beans: 5-10% discount at higher volumes
  - Milk: Weekly delivery contracts vs daily = savings
  - Cups/lids/sleeves: Bulk ordering saves 15-20%
- [ ] **Shared commissary prep** — If any location has kitchen space:
  - Prep food at one location, distribute to others
  - Eliminates duplicate food prep labor
  - More consistent quality

### Cross-Location Analytics
- [ ] **Benchmark locations against each other**
  - Revenue per labor hour
  - Average ticket
  - Waste percentage
  - Customer count by daypart
- [ ] **Identify what the best location does differently** — Then replicate

### Marketing Synergies
- [ ] **Single Instagram/social presence** with location tags
- [ ] **Unified Google Business profiles** — Optimized, consistent, responding to reviews
- [ ] **Cross-promotion** — "Visit all 3 locations this month, get a free bag of beans"

---

## 7. Customer Experience & Retention

### The 80/20 Rule
~20% of your customers generate ~60-80% of revenue. Identify and nurture them.

- [ ] **Know your regulars by name** — This is the #1 competitive advantage over chains
- [ ] **Speed of service during peak** — Target <3 min from order to handoff
- [ ] **Music, lighting, seating** — These seem soft but drive dwell time (longer stays in slow periods = more purchases)
- [ ] **WiFi as a feature** — Good WiFi attracts remote workers who spend $8-15 and stay 2-3 hours

### Google Reviews Strategy
- Current review count/rating across all 3 locations?
- [ ] **Target: 4.5+ stars, 200+ reviews per location**
- [ ] **Review generation:** We have the review-gen system from XPERIENCE — could adapt for coffee shops
- [ ] **Response to every review** within 24 hours (positive and negative)

## 8. Financial Health Check

### Key Metrics to Track Monthly
| Metric | Healthy Range | Action If Outside |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| COGS (all items) | 25-35% | Renegotiate suppliers or raise prices |
| Labor (fully loaded) | 30-35% | Adjust scheduling |
| Occupancy (rent + utilities) | 10-15% | Hard to change; affects location decisions |
| Net profit margin | 5-10% | Analyze which lever is off |
| Revenue per labor hour | $45-65 | Below $40 = overstaffed or underpriced |
| Customer count growth | +2-5% YoY | Stagnant = marketing problem |
| Average ticket | $6-8 (drinks only) | Below $5.50 = upsell problem |

### Break-Even Analysis
- [ ] **Calculate break-even for each location**
  - Fixed costs (rent, insurance, base labor) ÷ average margin per transaction
  - "How many customers per day do we need to cover costs?"
  - If a location needs 200 customers/day and gets 150, that's the gap to close

## Next Steps (Need From Marb)

To turn this from a framework into actionable recommendations:

1. **Shop names & locations** — So I can pull Google reviews, check competition, analyze foot traffic
2. **Current POS system** — What are they running?
3. **Approximate monthly revenue per location** — Even rough ranges help
4. **Current staffing model** — How many employees, shift structure?
5. **Food program details** — In-house baking, wholesale pastries, full kitchen?
6. **Current pain points** — What does Marb/family feel is the biggest issue?
7. **Ownership structure** — Is Marb managing actively or more of an investor/advisor?

With these answers, I can:
- Pull and analyze their Google review profiles
- Benchmark against SLC coffee market
- Build a prioritized 30-60-90 day action plan
- Create any tools/dashboards they need
- Set up automated review monitoring

## What I Can Build Right Now

Given our existing infrastructure:

| Tool | Effort | Impact |
|------|--------|--------|
| **Review monitoring** (adapt XPERIENCE system) | 2-3 hours | Automated Google/Yelp monitoring + response drafts |
| **Competitor analysis** (SLC coffee market) | 1-2 hours | Map competitors, pricing, reviews, positioning |
| **Daily sales dashboard** (if POS has API) | 4-6 hours | Real-time metrics across 3 locations |
| **Customer loyalty analysis** | 2-3 hours | If POS exports transaction data |
| **Menu engineering calculator** | 1-2 hours | Input COGS + sales data → optimization recommendations |

*This audit is a starting point. Coffee shops are deceptively complex businesses — the margins are thin but the optimization surface is huge. The multi-location advantage is real but only if you're actually leveraging it (consolidated purchasing, shared learnings, cross-staffing). Most 3-shop operators run them as 3 independent businesses and leave money on the table.*
