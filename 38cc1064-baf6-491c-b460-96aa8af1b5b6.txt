Awesome. Thanks for doing this and fixing it. It sounds like we should be good to go.
I have a question. So I have kind of a big project I want to start cranking on, but I want to make
sure it's approached really thoroughly and very correctly because it's actually like an enterprise
business. And so I'm just kind of wondering if you're ready to take that on and then also like
how you want me to approach prompting this kind of thing to make sure that all like the agent
systems and things we've researched and all those things work correctly in the planning phase of this.
