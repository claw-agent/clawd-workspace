# Visual Polish Guide 🎨

**Purpose:** When doing design/deck work, don't just do layout polish — do FULL visual polish.

---

## The Two Types of Polish

### ❌ Layout Polish (Insufficient)
- Reorganizing content
- Adding whitespace
- Typography hierarchy
- Color palette application
- **Result:** Looks "cleaner" but still flat/basic

### ✅ Visual Polish (What We Want)
- Real imagery (not placeholders)
- Custom icons (not emojis)
- Sophisticated graphics (diagrams, visualizations)
- Depth & texture (gradients, shadows, glows)
- Proper logo/brand mark
- Animated elements (if web)
- **Result:** Looks professional, premium, memorable

## Visual Polish Checklist

Before declaring a design "done," verify:

### Imagery
- [ ] Real photos sourced (Unsplash, Pexels, or AI-generated)
- [ ] No placeholder images or emojis as icons
- [ ] Images are high-res and properly cropped
- [ ] Consistent image style throughout

### Icons
- [ ] Using proper icon library (Lucide, Phosphor, Heroicons)
- [ ] Icons match the brand style
- [ ] Consistent stroke weight/size
- [ ] NO emojis as substitutes

### Graphics & Diagrams
- [ ] Flowcharts/flywheels are actual SVG graphics
- [ ] Data visualizations are properly designed
- [ ] Charts have visual hierarchy
- [ ] Network/relationship diagrams look professional

### Depth & Texture
- [ ] Subtle gradients (not flat colors)
- [ ] Soft shadows where appropriate
- [ ] Background textures (subtle)

- [ ] Layering creates depth

### Logo & Branding

## Process for Full Polish

1. **Content first** — Get the messaging/structure right
2. **Source assets** — Images, icons, textures BEFORE building
3. **Build with assets** — Don't use placeholders
4. **Add depth** — Gradients, shadows, glows
5. **Animate** — Motion if web
6. **QA** — Check against this checklist
