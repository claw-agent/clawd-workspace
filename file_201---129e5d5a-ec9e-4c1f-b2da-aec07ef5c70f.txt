I think sending everything might be confusing, but basically it realized that we were having a context overflow issue a ton of times because it was overloading tools.md.
I think the threshold for some reason is 20k and we were just over like 20,980 or something.
So it helped me compact that file down.
I guess I don't really understand why that would cause a context overflow or what that looks like, but we should be working well now.
We also realized that the million token limit is only available in beta for tier 4 API users and so our limits are where they should be now.
And so we should be good.
I guess I still have some concerns because I'm worried that we have some configuration issues or something.
That might be causing us to hit this context overflow limit a lot, but we should be able to work at least right now.
