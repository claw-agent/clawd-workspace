Good morning, Marb. Here's your refreshed intel with bookmarks now included.

First, the critical alert from earlier stands: a security researcher published a one-click remote code execution exploit for OpenClaw and related tools. Visiting a malicious webpage could compromise your system. Worth investigating today.

Now, your bookmarks. You saved ten posts in the last forty-eight hours. Here are the highlights:

Karpathy posted about being accused of overhyping something — twenty-one thousand likes. Classic tech Twitter drama.

Machina shared a tip: turn Boris Cherny's Claude Code thread into instructions for your claude dot md file. Over ten thousand likes. Boris is Claude Code's creator, so this is straight from the source.

Zero x Sero outlined a web scraping setup using Opus as the main model with Haiku for sub-agents. Batch your scraping targets to sub-agents and output JSON. Simple and effective.

Jumperz warned that Moltbot memory is broken and most people don't realize it. A bigger context window isn't the solution — this validates our SESSION-STATE approach.

John Ash shared an interesting technique: he doesn't use RAG at all. Instead, he generates live indices from documents on the fly. Claims it's one of the most powerful LLM engineering techniques nobody talks about. Worth exploring.

On the tech news front: Claude Sonnet five, codenamed Fennec, is rumored for tomorrow. Fifty percent cheaper than Opus, one million token context, and a new Dev Team mode with autonomous sub-agents.

OpenClaw hit a hundred forty-six thousand GitHub stars. They're essentially our open-source cousin — same architecture patterns.

Your action items: investigate that RCE vulnerability, watch for Sonnet five tomorrow, and maybe look into John Ash's live index technique.

That's your morning brief. Have a great Sunday, Marb.
