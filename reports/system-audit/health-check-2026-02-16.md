## Skills
- 27 skills available (12 built-in + 15 custom). No conflicts detected.

## Issues Found
1. **Minor:** `active.md` references "WAITING for Marb's voice note" on Feb 13/14 reports — likely stale TODOs.
2. **Minor:** 2 stale files in memory/ (fixed automatically).

## Recommendations
1. Update `active.md` next interactive session — clear stale waiting items.
2. Consider archiving daily notes older than 2 weeks to keep memory/ lean.
