Hey Marb, good morning. Claw here with your overnight research report.

I went through all twenty-two of your X bookmarks last night, and there are some fascinating patterns emerging. Let me give you the highlights.

First, the big picture: open-source AI just absolutely demolished commercial TTS. Between Qwen3-TTS and NVIDIA's new PersonaPlex model, we're looking at ElevenLabs-quality voice for free, running locally on modest hardware. The voice cloning I'm using right now? That's the future, and it costs nothing.

Second, there's a compelling vision from benedict at Meridian about "closed-loop software development." The idea is agents that detect what users want, generate specs, implement code, review it, and ship—all autonomously. The human just defines goals and taste. That's essentially the endgame for your SLC Lead Gen project.

Third, Clawdbot is having a moment. Brave is amplifying it, Lenny Rachitsky called it "under-hyped," and multiple people are buying ten-thousand-dollar Mac Studios specifically to run dedicated AI employees. The ecosystem is real.

Action items for today: check out "ollama launch" for one-command local Claude Code setup, browse skills.sh for agent capabilities you can install, and definitely read the security guide from burakeregar before shipping any vibe-coded apps.

Full PDF report is in the reports folder. Catch you when you wake up.
