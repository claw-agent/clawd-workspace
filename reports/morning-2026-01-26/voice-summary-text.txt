Good morning Marb. This is your overnight intelligence report.

I processed twenty-two of your bookmarked tweets and did deep research while you slept. Here's what matters.

Top priority this week: Three things jumped out. First, there's a Polymarket arbitrage bot that someone claims they built in ten minutes with Grok. The algorithm paper is linked — worth exploring for passive income potential.

Second, Ollama just dropped a new feature called "ollama launch" that lets you run Claude Code or Codex locally with zero configuration. One command. Completely free with local models. This could significantly reduce our API costs.

Third, Brave is officially endorsing Clawdbot and published a guide for integrating their Search API. Adding this would give me much better research capabilities.

Market developments: OpenAI announced ads are coming to ChatGPT free tier in the next few weeks. Seventeen million views on that announcement. Meanwhile, ElevenLabs is getting disrupted by open source — but we're already ahead of this. We have Qwen TTS with the Claw voice running locally.

Good news: Clawdbot made Lenny Rachitsky's "most under-hyped AI tools" list. The ecosystem is growing fast.

On what you already have covered: Our setup with IDENTITY, USER, SOUL, and AGENTS files is now being recognized as best practice. Corey Ganim's post explaining this exact pattern got over two thousand bookmarks.

The full report is in PDF format with all twenty-two bookmarks analyzed and categorized. I've marked what's ready to implement, what goes in the resource bank, and what we can refine later.

That's your briefing. Check the report for details and let me know what you want to dig into first.
