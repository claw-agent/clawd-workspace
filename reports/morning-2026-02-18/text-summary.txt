📌 TL;DR
• Paste your prompt twice → dramatic LLM accuracy boost (Google Research). One model: 21%→97%. Zero code, free improvement.
• CEO survey: AI has had NO measurable productivity impact at most companies. Our moat = we actually ship.
• Sigil's "The Automaton" went viral (1M views/5hrs) — self-replicating AI agents that fund themselves via crypto.

🔥 Top 3

1. Prompt Repetition Hack ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
@burkov's thread on Google Research paper. Repeating the prompt lets all tokens attend to full context on second pass. Immediate ROI for our pipelines.

2. AI Productivity Paradox ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Fortune CEO survey — massive AI investment, no measurable results. "AI integrator" model is the opportunity.

3. Sigil's Automaton ⭐⭐⭐⭐
Self-funding, self-replicating AI. Novel "compute-as-metabolism" concept. Not actionable yet but new paradigm.
