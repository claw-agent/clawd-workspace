☀️ Morning Intel — Tue Feb 17, 2026

TL;DR
• 🔴 18K OpenClaw instances exposed, 15% of community skills malicious — audit our setup
• 🌐 Chrome previews WebMCP — AI agents get native structured web access
• 🎙️ Voicebox: local voice cloning via Qwen3-TTS, no cloud needed

🔥 TOP 5

1. OpenClaw Security Audit ★★★★★
18K+ exposed instances found by researchers. ~15% of community skills contain malware/exfil/cred theft. Skills get removed but reappear under new identities. We need to audit our posture.

2. Chrome WebMCP ★★★★★
Google previewing protocol for AI agents to interact with websites through standardized APIs — not scraping, structured native access. 367 posts on X. Could change how all browser automation works.

3. AGENTS.md Research Paper ★★★★★
Academic paper evaluating whether AGENTS.md files actually improve coding agents. On arxiv with 102 HN points. Validates our entire approach.
