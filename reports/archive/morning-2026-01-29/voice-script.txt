Good morning, Marb. Here's what happened overnight.

We analyzed 19 new bookmarks and captured 17 interesting posts from your timeline.

Three things you should know right now:

First, there's a Clawdbot memory config tip from Alex Finn. Apparently enabling memory flush and session memory gives dramatically better recall. We should verify our config has this enabled.

Second, someone shared a QMD Skill that supposedly cuts token usage by 95 percent. That's huge for costs. The repo is on GitHub under levineam slash qmd skill.

Third, there's a great breakdown of steipete's agentic engineering workflow. He runs 5 to 10 agents in parallel and ships without manually reviewing code. The key insight is using conversation over prompts and strict validation loops.

Other highlights: Firecrawl released a CLI skill for agents, there's a self-optimizing prompt pattern that compressed 800 lines down to 70, and Naval had a spicy take about no point learning custom tools anymore that got 13,000 likes.

Your top action items: Check our Clawdbot memory config, review that QMD skill for token savings, and install the Firecrawl CLI.

Full report attached. Have a great day.
