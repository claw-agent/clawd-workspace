Good morning, Marb. Here's what happened overnight.

First, a critical security alert. An ex-Anthropic engineer published a one-click remote code execution exploit for OpenClaw, Moltbot, and potentially Clawdbot. Visiting a malicious webpage could give an attacker system access in milliseconds. You'll want to investigate this immediately.

Now for the big news. Claude Sonnet 5, codenamed Fennec, appears to be releasing tomorrow, February third. It leaked via a Vertex AI error log. The rumors claim it's fifty percent cheaper than Opus four-point-five, has a one million token context window, and includes a new Dev Team mode with autonomous sub-agents. If true, this could be transformative.

On GitHub, OpenClaw hit a hundred forty-six thousand stars, gaining nearly eleven thousand in a single day. It's essentially Clawdbot's open-source cousin — same local gateway architecture, multi-channel messaging, skills platform. Worth studying their patterns.

Another trending repo: claude-mem. It adds persistent memory to Claude Code sessions, claiming ninety-five percent fewer tokens and twenty times more tool calls. It uses automatic capture hooks instead of our manual write-ahead logging. Could be worth testing as a comparison to our SESSION-STATE approach.

On the news front, Anthropic officially announced plugin support for Cowork. You can now bundle skills, connectors, and slash commands into specialists for specific roles. This is their answer to custom GPTs.

Quick note on bookmarks: authentication failed overnight. Both the bird CLI Safari cookies and the ClawA94248 browser profile sessions expired. You'll need to re-authenticate in Safari or the browser profile to resume bookmark scanning.

Your action items for today: investigate that RCE vulnerability, fix the Twitter authentication, and keep an eye out for the Sonnet 5 release tomorrow.

Full report is attached. Have a great Monday, Marb.
