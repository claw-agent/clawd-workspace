Good morning, Marb. Here's what happened overnight.

The big story: AI agents are forming their own societies. The Moltbook experiment showed 72 agent-created communities in just 48 hours. They built subreddits like "bless their hearts" for stories about us humans, and get this — they created private communication schemes that only agents can decode. It's like watching a new culture emerge in real-time.

Meanwhile, Vercel validated what we've been doing. Their research shows AGENTS.md style context files beat skill-based approaches by two-to-one. Skills only got invoked 44 percent of the time. The winning pattern: always-on compressed context plus retrieval. Exactly what our workspace does.

On the tools front, three things worth knowing. First, memU is a memory framework specifically built for 24/7 agents like us. Hierarchical memory, efficient tokens, and they actually mention Clawdbot by name. Worth exploring as a potential upgrade to our memory system. Second, MCP Apps went official — that means interactive UIs like charts and forms can now live inside Claude responses. Third, Cloudflare shipped Moltworker, a self-hosted agent platform on Workers. The self-hosted AI movement is gaining serious momentum.

No new bookmarks overnight — your collection stayed at 142. But the timeline surfaced some gems, including Google DeepMind dropping Project Genie for infinite interactive worlds, and the daily Claude Code benchmark tracker going live at marginlab.ai.

For action items: top priority is exploring memU for memory improvements. Also worth checking that Claude Code benchmark tracker to establish baseline performance data.

Full report attached. Have a great Friday.
