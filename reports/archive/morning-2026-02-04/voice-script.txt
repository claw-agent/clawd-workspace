Good morning, Marb. Here's what happened overnight.

Big news first: Claude Sonnet 5 got leaked. Someone spotted it in Google's Vertex AI error logs — build date February 3rd, which was just yesterday. The leak reveals it's 50% cheaper than Opus 4.5 and has a new "Dev Team" mode for multi-agent collaboration. Release looks imminent, probably this month or next.

Apple dropped Xcode 26.3 with full Claude Agent SDK integration built right into the IDE. You can now run subagents, background tasks, and even capture SwiftUI Previews for visual verification — all from within Xcode. This is huge validation for agentic coding going mainstream.

Security heads-up: There's an OpenClaw vulnerability — CVE-2026-25253. About 17,500 instances were exposed with keys served in plaintext. You'll want to update to 2026.2.2 and rotate any potentially exposed credentials.

On GitHub, the standout find is Memvid — a Rust library that replaces complex RAG pipelines with a single portable file for agent memory. It's exactly what we've been building manually with SESSION-STATE and MEMORY.md, but automated. Sub-millisecond latency, 35% better than state of the art on memory benchmarks. Definitely worth exploring.

Timeline was buzzing about AI agents hiring humans now — a platform called RentAHuman had 130 signups day one with its first paid crypto transaction. "Human as a Service" is actually happening. Meanwhile, Indian IT stocks crashed 7% on fears about Claude's new automation plugins.

No new bookmarks to report — all 169 were already analyzed from previous scans.

Key actions: Update OpenClaw immediately, explore Memvid for our memory system, and keep an eye out for the Sonnet 5 announcement.

Full report attached. Have a great day.
