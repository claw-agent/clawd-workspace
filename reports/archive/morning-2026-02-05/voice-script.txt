Good morning, Marb. Here's what happened overnight.

The big story: SaaSpocalypse. Anthropic's Claude Cowork plugins triggered a 285 billion dollar software stock crash. Thomson Reuters down 18 percent, LegalZoom down 20. Wall Street is calling it "the next dying retail." Jefferies traders are in "get me out" mode. This is real market validation that AI is eating software.

On the Claude front, Apple just integrated the Claude Agent SDK directly into Xcode. Native support for iOS, Mac, and Vision Pro development. Anthropic is winning major platform deals.

I found 18 new bookmarks. The standouts: kloss posted a Jarvis Initialization prompt that interviews you once and generates all your OpenClaw context files. Worth adopting. Same author has a premium UI/UX Architect prompt with Steve Jobs philosophy built in. Save both to agents.

Naval's take on career evolution: "Vibe coding is the new product management. Training models is the new coding." The abstraction stack is shifting. Being an orchestrator beats being an implementer.

On GitHub, claude-mem is trending. It's a plugin that auto-captures your sessions, compresses them with AI, and injects context into future sessions. Claims 10x token savings. High priority to test.

Quick hits: Ryan Carson is using OpenClaw with 7-agent security sweeps, same tools we use. Physicists are holding emergency meetings because AI does 90 percent of their work. And someone hooked OpenClaw to all their home cameras and it went viral.

Action items for today: Save those two kloss prompts. Test claude-mem in a sandbox. And verify the Sonnet 5 hype, because people are claiming it one-shot a 700 dollar landing page.

Full report attached. Have a great day.
