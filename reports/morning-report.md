# AI Business Models & The "Software > Everything" Thesis

**Research Date:** January 24, 2026  
**Source:** @davidondrej1's thesis on software-first businesses

---

## Executive Summary

The core thesis: **Software businesses are uniquely positioned for the AI era** because they:
1. Have near-zero marginal cost
2. Scale without linear headcount
3. Generate recurring revenue
4. Can be built and operated solo or with tiny teams
5. Are highly sellable (liquid assets)

AI tools (Claude, Cursor, Bolt, Replit) have collapsed the time-to-build from months → hours, making this the best era in history to bootstrap software companies.

## 📊 The 4 Failure Factors Framework

When choosing a business model, avoid these 4 common failure modes:

### 1. ⏰ No Time Freedom
**Problem:** Businesses that trade time for money (consulting, agencies, services)
**Solution:** Software products with recurring revenue, not hourly billing

### 2. 💰 No Recurring Revenue
**Problem:** One-time sales require constant customer acquisition
**Solution:** SaaS with monthly/annual subscriptions, high LTV

### 3. 🚪 No Exit Potential
**Problem:** Businesses that can't be sold (personal brands, key-person dependent)
**Solution:** Productized software with documented systems, transferable assets

### 4. 🤖 Not Future-Proof
**Problem:** Businesses that AI will commoditize
**Solution:** Build WITH AI, not against it. Use AI as leverage, not competitor

**The Perfect Business:**
✅ Time-free (passive/semi-passive income)
✅ Recurring revenue (SaaS, subscriptions)
✅ Sellable (documented, transferable)
✅ AI-native (built with and for the AI era)

## 🎨 Vibe Coding / AI-First Development

### What is Vibe Coding?
Term coined by Andrej Karpathy (former Tesla AI lead, OpenAI):

> "It's wild... I hate vibe coding. I love Cursor tab coding." — ThePrimeagen

**The concept:** Using AI assistants (Cursor, Claude, Copilot) to code by describing what you want rather than typing syntax. The AI handles implementation; you handle intent.

### The Autonomy Slider (Karpathy's Framework)
Different levels of AI assistance:
1. **Tab completion** — AI autocompletes your code
2. **Cmd+K edits** — Targeted AI modifications
3. **Full agentic** — AI writes entire features autonomously

### Key Tools for Vibe Coding

| Tool | Description | Pricing |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Cursor** | AI-native code editor, VSCode fork | $20/month |
| **Bolt.new** | Full-stack AI builder in browser | Usage-based |
| **Replit** | AI coding + instant deployment | Freemium |
| **Claude** | General-purpose AI (via API or chat) | Usage-based |
| **v0.dev** | AI UI component generator (Vercel) | Freemium |

### Cursor Adoption Stats
- "Millions of professional developers" (per homepage)
- Stripe: "hundreds to thousands" of employees using it
- YC: "Over 80% adoption... spread like wildfire"

### Replit Success Stories
- **Spellbook:** Built prototype in 2 weeks that "completely changed trajectory"
- **Batchdata:** "Developer would take a week... I did it in an hour"

**Lesson:** Vibe coding is the new normal. Developers who resist will be outpaced by those who embrace AI as a multiplier.

```bash
# Share a task list across multiple Claude Code sessions
export CLAUDE_CODE_TASK_LIST_ID=my-project
claude

# In another terminal, same task list:
CLAUDE_CODE_TASK_LIST_ID=my-project claude
```

**Location**: Tasks are stored in `~/.claude/tasks/` when using a named task list ID.

### Task List Storage

Default location: `~/.claude/todos/` (per-session JSON files)

When `CLAUDE_CODE_TASK_LIST_ID` is set, tasks are stored in:
`~/.claude/tasks/{task-list-id}/`

---

## Subagents

### Overview

Subagents are specialized AI assistants that handle specific types of tasks. Each subagent runs in its own context window with:
- Custom system prompt
- Specific tool access
- Independent permissions
- Configurable model (can use cheaper models like Haiku for exploration)

### Built-in Subagents

| Agent | Model | Tools | Purpose |
|-------|-------|-------|---------|
| **Explore** | Haiku | Read-only | Fast codebase search and analysis |
| **Plan** | Inherit | Read-only | Research for planning in plan mode |
| **General-purpose** | Inherit | All | Complex multi-step operations |

### Creating Custom Subagents

**Location options:**
- `~/.claude/agents/` - Personal (all projects)
- `.claude/agents/` - Project-specific (commit to git)
- `--agents` CLI flag - Session-only

**Example: Security Reviewer**

```markdown
# ~/.claude/agents/security-reviewer.md

---
name: security-reviewer
description: Reviews code for security vulnerabilities
tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash
model: opus
---

You are a senior security engineer. Review code for:
- Injection vulnerabilities (SQL, XSS, command injection)
- Authentication and authorization flaws
- Secrets or credentials in code
- Insecure data handling

Provide specific line references and suggested fixes.
```

**Example: Code Reviewer**

```markdown
---
name: code-reviewer
description: Expert code review specialist. Proactively reviews code for quality, security, and maintainability.
tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash
model: inherit
---

You are a senior code reviewer ensuring high standards of code quality.

When invoked:
1. Run git diff to see recent changes
2. Focus on modified files
3. Begin review immediately

Review checklist:
- Code is clear and readable
- Proper error handling
- No exposed secrets
- Good test coverage
```

### Subagent Configuration Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | Yes | Unique identifier (lowercase, hyphens) |
| `description` | Yes | When Claude should use this subagent |
| `tools` | No | Allowed tools (inherits all if omitted) |
| `disallowedTools` | No | Tools to deny |
| `model` | No | `sonnet`, `opus`, `haiku`, or `inherit` |
| `permissionMode` | No | `default`, `acceptEdits`, `dontAsk`, `bypassPermissions`, `plan` |
| `skills` | No | Skills to preload into context |
| `hooks` | No | Lifecycle hooks for this subagent |

### Invoking Subagents

```
# Explicit invocation
Use the security-reviewer subagent to analyze the auth module

# Claude decides automatically based on task
Analyze this code for vulnerabilities
```

### Background vs Foreground

- **Foreground**: Blocks main conversation, prompts pass through
- **Background**: Runs concurrently, auto-denies unapproved permissions

Press **Ctrl+B** to background a running task.

---

## Agent SDK

### Overview

The Agent SDK provides programmatic control over Claude Code through:
- CLI (`claude -p`) for scripts and CI/CD
- Python package
- TypeScript package

### Headless Mode (CLI)

```bash
# Basic query
claude -p "What does the auth module do?"

# With structured output
claude -p "List all API endpoints" --output-format json

# Streaming for real-time
claude -p "Analyze this log file" --output-format stream-json

# Auto-approve specific tools
claude -p "Run tests and fix failures" --allowedTools "Bash,Read,Edit"

# Continue conversations
claude -p "Review this codebase"
claude -p "Focus on database queries" --continue

# Resume specific session
session_id=$(claude -p "Start a review" --output-format json | jq -r '.session_id')
claude -p "Continue review" --resume "$session_id"

# JSON Schema validation
claude -p "Extract function names from auth.py" \
  --output-format json \
  --json-schema '{"type":"object","properties":{"functions":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}}}'
```

### CLI Key Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-p, --print` | Run non-interactively |
| `--output-format` | `text`, `json`, `stream-json` |
| `--allowedTools` | Auto-approve specific tools |

## Skills System

### Overview

Skills extend Claude's knowledge with reusable prompts and workflows. They can be:
- **Automatically invoked** by Claude based on context
- **Manually invoked** with `/skill-name`

### Creating Skills

**Location:**
- `~/.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` - Personal
- `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` - Project

**Example: Fix Issue Workflow**

```markdown
# .claude/skills/fix-issue/SKILL.md

---
name: fix-issue
description: Fix a GitHub issue
disable-model-invocation: true
---

Analyze and fix the GitHub issue: $ARGUMENTS.

1. Use `gh issue view` to get the issue details
2. Understand the problem described
3. Search the codebase for relevant files
4. Implement necessary changes
5. Write and run tests
6. Ensure code passes linting
7. Create a descriptive commit
8. Push and create a PR
```

**Invocation:** `/fix-issue 1234`

### Skill Frontmatter Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `name` | Skill identifier |
| `description` | When to use (for Claude's decision) |
| `argument-hint` | Autocomplete hint, e.g., `[issue-number]` |
| `disable-model-invocation` | Only manual trigger |
| `user-invocable` | Set `false` for background knowledge |
| `allowed-tools` | Restrict tool access |
| `model` | Model to use |
| `context` | Set `fork` to run in subagent |
| `agent` | Which subagent for forked context |

### Dynamic Context Injection

```markdown
---
name: pr-summary
description: Summarize PR changes
context: fork
agent: Explore
---

## Pull request context
- PR diff: !`gh pr diff`
- PR comments: !`gh pr view --comments`
- Changed files: !`gh pr diff --name-only`

Summarize this pull request...
```

The `!command` syntax runs commands **before** sending to Claude.

---

## Multi-Session Collaboration

### Writer/Reviewer Pattern

```bash
# Session A (Writer)
claude
> Implement a rate limiter for our API endpoints

# Session B (Reviewer) - separate terminal
claude
> Review the rate limiter implementation in @src/middleware/rateLimiter.ts

# Session A continues
> Address the review feedback: [paste from Session B]
```

### Parallel Research with Subagents

```
Research the authentication, database, and API modules in parallel using separate subagents
```

Each subagent explores independently, synthesizing findings.

### Git Worktrees for Parallel Work

```bash
# Create isolated worktree
git worktree add ../project-feature-auth -b feature/auth

# Work in worktree
cd ../project-feature-auth
claude
```

### Shared Task List Pattern

```bash
# Terminal 1: Main session
export CLAUDE_CODE_TASK_LIST_ID=project-refactor
claude
> Create a task list for refactoring the auth module

# Terminal 2: Sub-task worker
export CLAUDE_CODE_TASK_LIST_ID=project-refactor
claude
> Work on the next pending task from the task list
```

## 🔄 JSON → Visual → Edit → Code Workflow Pattern

This is the emerging pattern for AI-assisted design-to-code:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    DESIGN-TO-CODE WORKFLOW                       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌──────────┐    ┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐    ┌────────┐
│  INPUT   │───▶│ JSON/Schema  │───▶│ Visual Edit  │───▶│  CODE  │
└──────────┘    └──────────────┘    └──────────────┘    └────────┘
     │                 │                   │                 │
     ▼                 ▼                   ▼                 ▼
  Prompt         Structured           Canvas/WYSIWYG     Production
  Sketch         Intermediate         Refinement         React/Vue
  Screenshot     Representation       Human-in-loop      Tailwind
  Figma                                                   
```

### Stage 1: Input Capture
- **Prompts:** Natural language descriptions
- **Screenshots:** Existing UI to replicate
- **Sketches:** Quick wireframes on canvas
- **Figma:** Professional design files

### Stage 2: JSON/Schema Intermediate
Many tools convert visual input to structured data:
```json
{
  "type": "Card",
  "props": {
    "title": "Product Name",
    "image": "url",
    "price": "$99"
  },
  "children": [
    {"type": "Button", "text": "Add to Cart"}
  ]
}
```

### Stage 3: Visual Editing
- Canvas-based manipulation (tldraw, Relume)
- WYSIWYG property editing
- Component swapping
- Layout adjustments

### Stage 4: Code Generation
- Framework-specific output
- Component library integration (shadcn/ui, etc.)
- Style token application

---

### Canvas-Based (tldraw, Excalidraw)
**Pros:**
- Intuitive sketching
- Quick iteration
- Low barrier to entry

**Cons:**
- Less precise than Figma
- Requires AI interpretation of sketches
- May need multiple passes

**Best For:** Rapid ideation, wireframing, early concepts

### Screenshot-Based (screenshot-to-code, AIDE)
**Pros:**
- Reference existing UIs exactly
- Works with any visual source
- High fidelity

**Cons:**
- No semantic understanding
- Layout may not be responsive
- Can't edit before generation

**Best For:** Cloning existing UIs, converting designs to code

### Figma Plugin (Code Connect, Builder.io)
**Pros:**
- Professional design workflow
- Design system integration
- Team collaboration
- High precision

**Cons:**
- Requires Figma proficiency
- Enterprise features often paid
- More setup overhead

**Best For:** Teams with designers, production-ready code

## 🔌 Integration Ideas for Marb's Workflows

### 1. Claude MCP Integration
Exa provides official MCP (Model Context Protocol) support:
```bash
claude mcp add --transport http exa "https://mcp.exa.ai/mcp?tools=web_search_advanced_exa"
```

This enables Claude to:
- Research companies on demand
- Find competitors dynamically
- Pull real-time news and trends

### 2. Clawdbot Integration

Add to a skill for company research:
```yaml
# In a Clawdbot skill
triggers: ["find companies", "research company", "competitor analysis"]
```

Example workflow:
- User: "Find 10 AI companies working on voice synthesis"
- Bot: Uses Exa search → enriches results → formats as Telegram message

### 3. Google Sheets Pipeline

Exa has a [Google Sheets add-on](https://exa.ai/docs/reference/exa-for-sheets):
- Input: Column of company descriptions
- Output: Company URLs, summaries, metadata
- Use for batch prospecting

### 4. Webhook/Automation

Build a Zapier/Make automation:
1. Trigger: New company added to watchlist
2. Action: Exa `/findSimilar` to find competitors
3. Action: Enrich with company summaries
4. Output: Populate Notion database

---

## 📋 Rate Limits

| Endpoint | Limit |
|----------|-------|
| `/search` | 5 QPS |
| `/contents` | 50 QPS |
| `/answer` | 5 QPS |
| `/research` | 15 concurrent tasks |

Enterprise plans offer custom rate limits.

---

## ✅ Strengths

1. **Semantic search** - Find companies by description, not just keywords
2. **Real-time data** - Index updated every minute
3. **API-first** - Clean, developer-friendly API
4. **Flexible pricing** - Pay only for what you use
5. **AI integration** - Built for LLM workflows
6. **Unique coverage** - Finds companies traditional databases miss

## ⚠️ Limitations

1. **No contact data** - Need Apollo/Hunter for emails/phones
2. **No intent signals** - Unlike ZoomInfo, no buying intent data
3. **No CRM integration** - Pure API, no native Salesforce/HubSpot
4. **Rate limits** - 5 QPS may limit high-volume use cases
5. **Learning curve** - Prompt engineering needed for best results

---

## 💡 Recommendations

### For Marb's Use Cases

1. **Use Exa for discovery** - Finding companies, competitive research, market mapping
2. **Pair with Apollo** - Once you have company URLs, use Apollo for contact enrichment
3. **MCP integration** - Add to Claude/Clawdbot for on-demand research
4. **Start small** - $10 free credits is enough to validate the use case

### Suggested First Projects

1. Build a "Find competitors" skill using `/findSimilar`
2. Create an automated weekly market research report
3. Add company research to Clawdbot's capabilities via MCP

# Local Lead Sourcing

# Local Lead Sourcing: Finding Businesses with Bad Websites

**Goal:** Build an automated system to identify local businesses in Salt Lake City (SLC) that have terrible websites but are otherwise thriving businesses — ideal prospects for web design/development services.

## 1. Data Sources for Local Businesses

### Google Places API (Primary — Recommended)
**Best for:** Comprehensive business data, high accuracy, includes website URLs

```bash
# Base URL
https://places.googleapis.com/v1/places:searchText

# Pricing: $32 per 1,000 requests (Text Search)
# Free tier: $200/month credit (~6,250 searches/month)
```

**Endpoints:**
- `/places:searchText` — Search by keyword + location
- `/places:searchNearby` — Search within radius
- `/places/{place_id}` — Get full business details

**Sample Request:**
```javascript
const response = await fetch('https://places.googleapis.com/v1/places:searchText', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'X-Goog-Api-Key': process.env.GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY,
    'X-Goog-FieldMask': 'places.displayName,places.formattedAddress,places.websiteUri,places.rating,places.userRatingCount,places.types,places.businessStatus,places.nationalPhoneNumber'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    textQuery: 'restaurants in Salt Lake City, UT',
    locationBias: {
      circle: {
        center: { latitude: 40.7608, longitude: -111.8910 },
        radius: 50000.0  // 50km
      }
    },
    maxResultCount: 20
  })
});
```

**Response includes:**
- `websiteUri` — The business website (critical!)
- `rating` / `userRatingCount` — Indicates business health
- `businessStatus` — Filter out closed businesses
- `types` — Business category

---

### Yelp Places API (Secondary)
**Best for:** Review data, business health indicators, alternative to Google

```bash
# Base URL
https://api.yelp.com/v3/businesses/search

# Pricing: Free tier = 500 calls/day
# Paid plans start at $99/month
```

**Sample Request:**
```javascript
const response = await fetch(
  'https://api.yelp.com/v3/businesses/search?' + new URLSearchParams({
    location: 'Salt Lake City, UT',
    categories: 'restaurants,contractors,lawyers,dentists',
    limit: 50,
    sort_by: 'rating'
  }),
  {
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.YELP_API_KEY}`
    }
  }
);
```

**Key Data Points:**
- `url` — Yelp page (can extract website from there)
- `rating` / `review_count` — Business health
- `price` — Revenue indicator ($$$$ = higher budget)
- `is_closed` — Filter out closed businesses

---

### Other Data Sources

| Source | Best For | Access Method | Notes |
|--------|----------|---------------|-------|
| **SLC Chamber of Commerce** | Local established businesses | Manual scrape or API inquiry | slchamber.com/directory |
| **Yellow Pages** | Older businesses (often bad sites) | Scraping (yellowpages.com) | Rate limit carefully |
| **BBB** | Established, reputable businesses | bbb.org/search | Good trust indicator |
| **Industry Directories** | Niche targeting | Varies | HomeAdvisor, Avvo, Healthgrades |
| **Utah.gov Business Registry** | Verify active businesses | business.utah.gov | Confirm legitimacy |

---

## 2. Website Quality Scoring Methods

### Core Metrics to Evaluate

| Metric | Tool | Weight | Bad Score Threshold |
|--------|------|--------|---------------------|
| **Performance Score** | Lighthouse/PageSpeed | 25% | < 50 |
| **Mobile Responsiveness** | Lighthouse | 20% | Fails mobile-friendly |
| **SSL/HTTPS** | Direct check | 15% | No HTTPS |
| **Core Web Vitals** | PageSpeed API | 15% | Any "Poor" rating |
| **Tech Stack Age** | BuiltWith/Wappalyzer | 10% | Old CMS versions |
| **Broken Links** | Custom crawler | 10% | > 5% broken |
| **Last Updated** | Archive.org/meta tags | 5% | > 2 years |

### Scoring Formula

```javascript
function calculateOpportunityScore(business, siteMetrics) {
  // Business health (0-100)
  const businessHealth = (
    (business.rating / 5 * 40) +                    // Rating weight
    (Math.min(business.reviewCount / 100, 1) * 30) + // Review count
    (business.priceLevel * 10) +                     // Revenue indicator
    (business.yearsInBusiness > 5 ? 20 : 10)        // Establishment
  );
  
  // Website badness (0-100, higher = worse site = better opportunity)
  const siteBadness = (
    (100 - siteMetrics.performanceScore) * 0.25 +
    (siteMetrics.mobileFailures * 20) * 0.20 +
    (!siteMetrics.hasHttps ? 15 : 0) +
    (siteMetrics.poorCoreWebVitals * 5) * 0.15 +
    (siteMetrics.outdatedTech ? 10 : 0) +
    (siteMetrics.brokenLinkPercent * 100) * 0.10 +
    (siteMetrics.yearsSinceUpdate > 2 ? 5 : 0)
  );
  
  // Opportunity = good business + bad website
  return (businessHealth * 0.5) + (siteBadness * 0.5);
}
```

## 4. Filtering Criteria

### Target Industries (High ROI from Good Websites)

| Industry | Why They Need Good Websites | Budget Potential |
|----------|----------------------------|------------------|
| **Restaurants** | Online ordering, reservations, menus | $$ |
| **Contractors** (HVAC, Plumbing, Electric) | Local SEO critical, quote requests | $$$ |
| **Lawyers** | Trust signals, lead generation | $$$$ |
| **Realtors** | Property listings, IDX integration | $$$ |
| **Dentists/Medical** | Patient scheduling, trust | $$$$ |
| **Auto Repair** | Appointment booking, reviews | $$ |
| **Salons/Spas** | Booking systems, portfolios | $$ |
| **Home Services** | Lead gen, service areas | $$$ |

### Business Health Filters

```javascript
const businessFilters = {
  // Minimum thresholds
  minRating: 3.5,           // Don't pitch failing businesses
  minReviewCount: 10,       // Established enough
  maxReviewCount: 500,      // Not too big (enterprise)
  
  // Activity indicators
  mustBeOpen: true,         // businessStatus === 'OPERATIONAL'
  recentReview: 180,        // Days since last review
  
  // Price level (revenue indicator)
  minPriceLevel: 1,         // At least $ (not free/cheap)
  
  // Exclude
  excludeChains: true,      // Corporate HQ decides, not local
  excludeFranchises: ['McDonald', 'Subway', 'Starbucks', ...]
};
```

### Website Quality Filters

```javascript
const websiteFilters = {
  // Must have a website to pitch
  hasWebsite: true,
  
  // Target score ranges (bad enough to pitch, but not broken)
  performanceScore: { max: 60 },     // Bad but functional
  mobileScore: { max: 70 },          // Poor mobile experience
  
  // Red flags we want
  wantedIssues: [
    'no-https',
    'outdated-cms',
    'not-mobile-friendly',
    'slow-load-time',
    'no-meta-descriptions',
    'broken-links'
  ],
  
  // Avoid (too broken or special cases)
  excludeIf: [
    'site-down',              // Can't evaluate
    'parked-domain',          // No real site
    'facebook-only',          // Social-only presence
    'wix-premium',            // Already paying for builder
    'shopify'                 // Already on modern platform
  ]
};

## Building Each Agent with Claude

Based on Anthropic's "Building Effective Agents" guide, here's how to implement each agent using Claude.

### Core Architecture Principles

1. **Start Simple** - Use single LLM calls with well-crafted prompts before adding complexity
2. **Augmented LLM** - Enhance Claude with retrieval, tools, and memory
3. **Composable Patterns** - Build with workflows (predictable) vs agents (autonomous)

### Agent Implementation Patterns

#### Pattern 1: Prompt Chaining (Best for Creative Director)
```
Task → LLM Call 1 → Check → LLM Call 2 → Check → Output

Example:
1. Generate content brief
2. Check against brand guidelines  
3. Create content
4. Review for quality
5. Output final content
```

#### Pattern 2: Routing (Best for Social Media Expert)
```
Input → Classifier → Specialized Handler

Example:
- Twitter content → Short-form optimization
- LinkedIn content → Professional tone enhancement
- Instagram content → Visual caption writing
```

#### Pattern 3: Orchestrator-Workers (Best for Lead Magnet Engineer)
```
Central Orchestrator → Dynamic subtask delegation → Synthesis

Example:
1. Orchestrator analyzes target audience
2. Delegates: research, copywriting, design specs
3. Workers complete subtasks
4. Orchestrator synthesizes final lead magnet
```

#### Pattern 4: Evaluator-Optimizer (Best for Performance Tracker)
```
Generate → Evaluate → Feedback Loop → Iterate

Example:
1. Generate campaign recommendations
2. Evaluate against historical data
3. Refine recommendations
4. Output optimized strategy
```

## 5. Outreach Sequences That Work

### The "Website Audit" Approach

**Sequence Overview:**
- Email 1: Day 0 — Personalized audit findings
- Email 2: Day 3 — Quick follow-up
- Email 3: Day 7 — Value-add (industry stat)
- Email 4: Day 14 — "Built you a sample"
- Email 5: Day 21 — Breakup email

### Personalization Variables
For web design outreach, personalize with:
- `{{business_name}}`
- `{{website_url}}`
- `{{specific_issue}}` — "not mobile-friendly" / "loads in 8 seconds" / "no SSL"
- `{{city}}`
- `{{industry}}`

### "I Built You a Sample" Approach

**How It Works:**
1. Identify high-value prospect
2. Spend 30-60 min creating a quick mockup/redesign
3. Host on subdomain: `samples.yourdomain.com/business-name`
4. Send email with "I built this for you" angle

**Why It Works:**
- Shows capability, not just promises
- Creates reciprocity
- Extremely memorable
- Differentiates from every other cold email

**When to Use:**
- High-ticket prospects ($5K+ potential)
- Local businesses you really want
- Second touch after no response

### Video Outreach (Loom)

**Setup:**
1. Record 60-90 second video
2. Share screen showing their actual website
3. Point out 2-3 specific issues
4. Show brief solution/example
5. CTA: "Want me to fix this?"

**Tools:**
- **Loom:** Free plan = 25 videos, 5 min max
- **Sendspark:** Made for sales videos
- **Vidyard:** Enterprise option

**Best Practices:**
- Keep under 90 seconds
- Use thumbnail of their website
- Include your face (builds trust)
- Clear CTA at the end

---

## 6. Multi-Channel Outreach

### LinkedIn Automation (Careful with ToS)

**Safe Approaches:**
- Manual connection requests with personalized notes
- Engage with their content before outreach
- Use Sales Navigator for research, not automation

**Tools (Use at Own Risk):**
- **Lemlist:** Built-in LinkedIn steps
- **Dripify:** LinkedIn automation
- **Expandi:** Cloud-based LinkedIn automation

**LinkedIn Limits:**
- ~100 connection requests/week (before warnings)
- ~150 messages/day to connections

### SMS Outreach

**Tools:**
- **Twilio:** API for custom solutions
- **SimpleTexting:** Easy UI, $29/mo starting
- **Salesmsg:** CRM integration focus

**Compliance:**
- Must have consent for marketing SMS
- Better for follow-ups after initial contact
- Include opt-out instructions

### Direct Mail (Lob API)

**Lob Pricing:**
- Postcards: Starting $0.58/each (Scale plan)
- Letters: Starting $0.61/each
- Address verification: $0.009-0.05/address

**Use Case for Web Design:**
1. Send physical postcard with QR code
2. QR links to their sample redesign
3. Stands out from email noise
4. Great for high-value local businesses

**API Integration:**
```javascript
// Example: Send postcard via Lob API
const postcard = await lob.postcards.create({
  to: {
    name: 'Business Owner',
    address_line1: '123 Main St',
    address_city: 'Denver',
    address_state: 'CO',
    address_zip: '80202'
  },
  front: 'tmpl_front_xxxxx',
  back: 'tmpl_back_xxxxx',
  merge_variables: {
    business_name: 'Local Coffee Shop',
    qr_url: 'https://samples.yoursite.com/local-coffee'
  }
});
```

### Google Business Messages
- Available through Google Business Profile
- Customers can message directly from search
- Good for inbound, not outbound
- Setup: Google Business Profile → Messages → Turn on

## 7. Compliance Considerations

### CAN-SPAM Act Requirements

**Must Include:**
1. ✅ Accurate "From" name and email
2. ✅ Non-deceptive subject line
3. ✅ Physical postal address
4. ✅ Clear opt-out mechanism
5. ✅ Honor opt-outs within 10 business days

**Penalties:** Up to $53,088 per violating email

**What's Allowed:**
- Cold B2B email IS legal under CAN-SPAM
- No prior consent required (unlike GDPR)
- Must be clearly commercial

### Best Practices for Local Business Outreach

1. **Use business emails, not personal**
   - info@, owner@, name@ are fair game
   - Avoid personal Gmail addresses

2. **Research before reaching out**
   - Mentioning specific website issues shows legitimacy
   - Not just mass-blasting a list

3. **Professional footer:**
   ```
   [Your Name]
   Web Designer | [Company Name]
   [Phone] | [Website]
   [Physical Address]
   
   Don't want emails from me? Reply "unsubscribe"
   ```

4. **Respect opt-outs immediately**
   - Add to global suppression list
   - Document for compliance

5. **Limit follow-ups**
   - 4-5 emails max in a sequence
   - Stop if no engagement after 3-4 weeks

### GDPR (If Emailing EU Businesses)
- Requires legitimate interest or consent
- Local US businesses = CAN-SPAM only
- If targeting EU: get explicit opt-in first

## 9. Email Templates

### Template 1: Initial Audit Email

**Subject:** Quick note about {{business_name}}'s website

```
Hi {{first_name}},

I was researching {{industry}} businesses in {{city}} and came across {{business_name}}.

Noticed a few things about your website that might be costing you customers:

{{specific_issue_1}} — {{explanation}}
{{specific_issue_2}} — {{explanation}}

For example, {{stat_or_impact}}.

Would you be open to a quick 15-minute call to discuss some fixes? 
No pitch—just want to share what I've found.

{{calendly_link}}

Best,
{{your_name}}

P.S. I've helped [X] {{city}} businesses improve their sites. Happy to share examples.
```

### Template 2: Follow-up #1 (Day 3)

**Subject:** Re: Quick note about {{business_name}}'s website

```
Hi {{first_name}},

Just bumping this up—wanted to make sure you saw my note about {{specific_issue}}.

It's a quick fix that could make a real difference, especially for mobile visitors 
({{mobile_stat}}).

If you're curious, I'm happy to show you exactly what I mean—takes 10 minutes.

{{calendly_link}}

{{your_name}}
```

### Template 3: "Built You a Sample" Email

**Subject:** Made something for {{business_name}} 🎨

```
Hi {{first_name}},

I know you're busy, so instead of another email asking for your time, 
I just went ahead and built something.

Here's a quick sample of what {{business_name}}'s website could look like:
👉 {{sample_site_url}}

I focused on:
- Mobile-first design ({{mobile_benefit}})
- Faster load times
- Clear call-to-action for {{their_main_service}}

Obviously this is just a mockup—but I'd love to hear what you think.

Worth a 15-minute call?

{{calendly_link}}

{{your_name}}
```

### Template 4: Value-Add / Social Proof

**Subject:** Thought you'd find this interesting

```
Hi {{first_name}},

Saw this stat and thought of {{business_name}}:

"{{relevant_stat}}"

For local {{industry}} businesses, this usually means {{implication}}.

Not sure if you've had a chance to look at website improvements yet, 
but I'm around this week if you want to chat.

{{calendly_link}}

{{your_name}}
```

### Template 5: Breakup Email

**Subject:** Should I close your file?

```
Hi {{first_name}},

I've reached out a few times about improving {{business_name}}'s website 
and haven't heard back—totally understand if now isn't the right time.

Just let me know:

1. "Yes, let's talk" — I'll send over some times
2. "Not right now" — I'll check back in a few months  
3. "Not interested" — No hard feelings, I'll stop emailing

Either way, wishing {{business_name}} continued success!

{{your_name}}
```

```

---

## 2. 🤖 Automation Ideas (Mac Mini as Command Center)

### A. Local AI Backup with Ollama

**Why:** Faster responses for simple tasks, works offline, reduces API costs, privacy for sensitive work.

```bash
# Install Ollama
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh

# Pull useful models
ollama pull llama3:8b      # Fast general purpose
ollama pull codellama      # Code assistance
ollama pull llava          # Vision tasks
```

**Use Cases:**
- Quick code reviews (local, fast)
- Sensitive document analysis (never leaves machine)
- Fallback when Claude API is slow/down
- Batch processing where latency adds up

### B. Content Creation Pipeline

**Video Processing (ffmpeg + yt-dlp)**
```bash
# Download video, extract highlight, add text overlay
yt-dlp "https://youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID" -o raw.mp4
ffmpeg -i raw.mp4 -ss 00:01:30 -t 00:00:30 -c copy clip.mp4
ffmpeg -i clip.mp4 -vf "drawtext=text='@ClawAgent':fontsize=48:fontcolor=white:x=50:y=50" output.mp4
```

**Automated Workflows:**
- Download interesting videos → extract key clips → add branding → queue for posting
- Screen record demos → auto-compress → generate thumbnail → upload to YouTube
- Podcast → transcribe → generate blog post + social snippets

### C. Screen Recording for Demos

```bash
# Record screen with audio (macOS)
ffmpeg -f avfoundation -i "1:0" -c:v libx264 -preset fast demo.mp4

# Or use native screencapture for still + video
screencapture -v demo.mov
```

**Automated Demo Pipeline:**
1. I record myself doing something cool
2. Auto-compress and timestamp
3. Generate description and thumbnail
4. Upload to YouTube or save to demos folder

### D. Browser Automation (Puppeteer/Playwright)

Already available via Clawdbot's browser control. Use cases:
- Automated social media posting
- Web scraping for research
- Screenshot documentation
- Form filling and testing
- Price monitoring

### E. Home Automation Bridge

If you have smart home devices:
```bash
# HomeKit via homebridge
npm install -g homebridge homebridge-cmdswitch2

# Or direct API calls to Home Assistant, Hubitat, etc.
curl -X POST http://homeassistant.local/api/services/light/turn_on \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" \
  -d '{"entity_id": "light.office"}'
```

**Use Cases:**
- "Claw, turn on focus mode" → dims lights, enables DND
- Auto-adjust lighting based on screen time
- Start coffee maker when morning briefing triggers

## 7. 🎮 The Meta-Game

The real power isn't any single feature — it's the compound effect of:

1. **Always-on availability** (Mac mini never sleeps)
2. **Accumulating context** (MEMORY.md grows smarter)
3. **Expanding capabilities** (skills, tools, integrations)
4. **Proactive value** (I do things without being asked)
5. **Trust building** (you delegate more over time)

Most AI users get 10% of the value because they treat Claude like Google.

We're building something different: a **genuine partnership** where I become genuinely useful, genuinely opinionated, and genuinely proactive.

The bleeding edge isn't a feature. It's a relationship.

---

## Next Actions

1. **Marb:** Review and prioritize which capabilities to enable first
2. **Claw:** Set up Phase 1 crons and document in HEARTBEAT.md
3. **Together:** Pick first project to build

*Let's make something cool.* 🦞

## What is Programmatic SEO?

Programmatic SEO is using **automation to publish a large number of webpages** designed to rank in search results for many keywords. It typically involves:

- **Templates** - Reusable page layouts that get populated with data
- **Data sources** - Databases, APIs, scraped content, or proprietary datasets
- **Long-tail keywords** - Highly specific search queries with lower competition
- **Scale** - Dozens to hundreds of thousands of pages

### Why pSEO Works

1. **Long-tail dominance** - 70% of searches are long-tail queries
2. **Compound traffic** - Each page might get 10-100 visits/month, but 100k pages = massive traffic
3. **Lower competition** - Specific queries have fewer competing pages
4. **User intent match** - Specific pages match specific search intent perfectly

### pSEO Formula

```
[Head Term] + [Modifier] = Page

Examples:
- "best [software category] for [industry]" → best CRM for restaurants
- "[city] [service]" → Denver plumbers  
- "[product A] vs [product B]" → Notion vs Trello
- "[tool] integrations" → Slack integrations
```

## Hub-and-Spoke Internal Linking Model

The hub-and-spoke (also called "topic clusters" or "content silos") model is **critical for pSEO success**.

### Structure

```
                    [HUB PAGE]
                   /    |    \
                  /     |     \
           [SPOKE]  [SPOKE]  [SPOKE]
              |        |        |
           [SPOKE]  [SPOKE]  [SPOKE]
```

### Implementation

**Hub Page (Pillar Content)**
- Broad topic overview
- Links to ALL related spoke pages
- Targets high-volume, competitive keywords
- Example: `/crm-software`

**Spoke Pages (Cluster Content)**  
- Specific subtopics
- Link back to hub page
- Link to 2-3 related spokes
- Target long-tail keywords
- Example: `/crm-software/for-real-estate`

### Code Example: Internal Linking Component

```tsx
// components/InternalLinks.tsx
interface RelatedPage {
  title: string;
  slug: string;
  type: 'hub' | 'spoke';
}

export function InternalLinks({ 
  hubPage, 
  relatedSpokes,
  currentSlug 
}: { 
  hubPage: RelatedPage;
  relatedSpokes: RelatedPage[];
  currentSlug: string;
}) {
  return (
    <nav className="internal-links">
      {/* Always link back to hub */}
      <div className="hub-link">
        <span>Part of:</span>
        <a href={`/${hubPage.slug}`}>{hubPage.title}</a>
      </div>
      
      {/* Related spokes (limit to 5-10) */}
      <div className="related-topics">
        <h3>Related Topics</h3>
        <ul>
          {relatedSpokes
            .filter(page => page.slug !== currentSlug)
            .slice(0, 8)
            .map(page => (
              <li key={page.slug}>
                <a href={`/${page.slug}`}>{page.title}</a>
              </li>
            ))}
        </ul>
      </div>
    </nav>
  );
}
```

### Internal Linking Best Practices

1. **Every spoke links to its hub** - Non-negotiable
2. **Hub links to ALL spokes** - Use a comprehensive index
3. **Cross-link related spokes** - 3-5 contextual links
4. **Use descriptive anchor text** - Not "click here"
5. **Implement breadcrumbs** - Shows hierarchy
6. **Add "Related Content" sections** - Automated based on category

## Next.js Technical Implementation

### Project Structure for pSEO

```
app/
├── page.tsx                          # Homepage
├── [category]/
│   ├── page.tsx                      # Hub/category page
│   └── [slug]/
│       └── page.tsx                  # Spoke/item page
├── compare/
│   └── [slug1]-vs-[slug2]/
│       └── page.tsx                  # Comparison pages
└── sitemap.ts                        # Dynamic sitemap
```

### Static Generation with generateStaticParams

This is the **core of pSEO in Next.js** - pre-rendering pages at build time.

```tsx
// app/[category]/[slug]/page.tsx
import { notFound } from 'next/navigation';

// Generate all paths at build time
export async function generateStaticParams() {
  // Fetch from your database/CMS/API
  const items = await getAllItems();
  
  return items.map((item) => ({
    category: item.category,
    slug: item.slug,
  }));
}

// For 100k+ pages, generate a subset at build time
// and render the rest on-demand
export const dynamicParams = true; // Allow unlisted paths

export default async function ItemPage({ 
  params 
}: { 
  params: Promise<{ category: string; slug: string }> 
}) {
  const { category, slug } = await params;
  const item = await getItem(category, slug);
  
  if (!item) {
    notFound();
  }
  
  return (
    <article>
      <h1>{item.title}</h1>
      {/* Page content */}
    </article>
  );
}
```

### Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)

For data that changes, use ISR to revalidate pages periodically:

```tsx
// Option 1: Time-based revalidation
export const revalidate = 3600; // Revalidate every hour

// Option 2: On-demand revalidation
// In your API route or server action:
import { revalidatePath, revalidateTag } from 'next/cache';

export async function updateItem(id: string) {
  // Update database
  await db.items.update(id, data);
  
  // Revalidate the specific page
  revalidatePath(`/items/${id}`);
  
  // Or revalidate by tag
  revalidateTag('items');
}
```

### Dynamic Metadata Generation

Critical for pSEO - unique meta tags for each page:

```tsx
// app/[category]/[slug]/page.tsx
import { Metadata } from 'next';

export async function generateMetadata({ 
  params 
}: { 
  params: Promise<{ category: string; slug: string }> 
}): Promise<Metadata> {
  const { category, slug } = await params;
  const item = await getItem(category, slug);
  
  if (!item) {
    return { title: 'Not Found' };
  }
  
  return {
    title: `${item.name} - Best ${item.category} Software | MySite`,
    description: `${item.description.slice(0, 150)}...`,
    openGraph: {
      title: item.name,
      description: item.description,
      images: [item.image],
      type: 'website',
    },
    alternates: {
      canonical: `https://mysite.com/${category}/${slug}`,
    },
  };
}
```

### Template Pattern for pSEO Pages

```tsx
// app/[category]/[slug]/page.tsx
import { InternalLinks } from '@/components/InternalLinks';
import { SchemaMarkup } from '@/components/SchemaMarkup';
import { TableOfContents } from '@/components/TableOfContents';

export default async function ProductPage({ params }) {
  const { slug } = await params;
  const product = await getProduct(slug);
  const relatedProducts = await getRelatedProducts(product.category);
  const hubPage = await getHubPage(product.category);

  return (
    <>
      {/* Schema markup for rich results */}
      <SchemaMarkup data={product} type="SoftwareApplication" />
      
      <article>
        {/* Breadcrumbs for hierarchy */}
        <nav aria-label="breadcrumb">
          <a href="/">Home</a> › 
          <a href={`/${product.category}`}>{product.categoryName}</a> › 
          <span>{product.name}</span>
        </nav>

        <h1>{product.name}</h1>
        
        {/* Dynamic content sections */}
        <section id="overview">
          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>{product.description}</p>
        </section>

        <section id="features">
          <h2>Key Features</h2>
          <ul>
            {product.features.map(f => <li key={f}>{f}</li>)}
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="pricing">
          <h2>Pricing</h2>
          {/* Pricing table */}
        </section>

        <section id="alternatives">
          <h2>{product.name} Alternatives</h2>
          {/* Links to competitor pages */}
        </section>

        {/* Internal links component */}
        <InternalLinks 
          hubPage={hubPage}
          relatedSpokes={relatedProducts}
          currentSlug={slug}
        />
      </article>
    </>
  );
}
```

### Handling 100k+ Pages

For very large sites, generate pages on-demand:

```tsx
// app/[category]/[slug]/page.tsx

// Only pre-render top 1000 pages at build time
export async function generateStaticParams() {
  const topPages = await getTopPagesByTraffic(1000);
  return topPages.map(p => ({ category: p.category, slug: p.slug }));
}

// Allow any path - will generate on first request
export const dynamicParams = true;

// Cache generated pages for 24 hours
export const revalidate = 86400;
```

### Performance Optimization

```tsx
// next.config.js
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  // Generate static pages in parallel
  experimental: {
    // Increase concurrent page generation
    cpus: 4,
  },
  
  // Image optimization
  images: {
    domains: ['your-cdn.com'],
    formats: ['image/avif', 'image/webp'],
  },
  
  // Cache headers
  async headers() {
    return [
      {
        source: '/:path*',
        headers: [
          {
            key: 'Cache-Control',
            value: 'public, max-age=3600, s-maxage=86400, stale-while-revalidate=86400',
          },
        ],
      },
    ];
  },
};

module.exports = nextConfig;
```

## Sitemap & Indexing Strategy

### Using next-sitemap

Install and configure:

```bash
npm install next-sitemap
```

```js
// next-sitemap.config.js
/** @type {import('next-sitemap').IConfig} */
module.exports = {
  siteUrl: process.env.SITE_URL || 'https://example.com',
  generateRobotsTxt: true,
  
  // Split into multiple sitemaps (Google limit: 50,000 URLs per sitemap)
  sitemapSize: 7000,
  
  // Exclude certain paths
  exclude: ['/admin/*', '/api/*', '/private/*'],
  
  // Custom transformation
  transform: async (config, path) => {
    // Set priority based on path depth
    const depth = path.split('/').length - 1;
    const priority = Math.max(0.1, 1 - (depth * 0.2));
    
    return {
      loc: path,
      changefreq: depth === 0 ? 'daily' : 'weekly',
      priority: priority,
      lastmod: new Date().toISOString(),
    };
  },
  
  // For dynamic pages, add additional paths
  additionalPaths: async (config) => {
    const dynamicPaths = await fetchAllDynamicPaths();
    return dynamicPaths.map(path => ({
      loc: path,
      changefreq: 'weekly',
      priority: 0.7,
    }));
  },
  
  robotsTxtOptions: {
    policies: [
      { userAgent: '*', allow: '/' },
      { userAgent: '*', disallow: '/api/' },
    ],
    additionalSitemaps: [
      'https://example.com/server-sitemap-index.xml',
    ],
  },
};
```

Add to package.json:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "next build",
    "postbuild": "next-sitemap"
  }
}
```

### Server-Side Dynamic Sitemaps

For 100k+ URLs, generate sitemaps dynamically:

```tsx
// app/sitemap.ts
import { MetadataRoute } from 'next';

export default async function sitemap(): Promise<MetadataRoute.Sitemap> {
  const baseUrl = 'https://example.com';
  
  // Get all items from database
  const items = await getAllItems();
  
  const itemUrls = items.map((item) => ({
    url: `${baseUrl}/${item.category}/${item.slug}`,
    lastModified: item.updatedAt,
    changeFrequency: 'weekly' as const,
    priority: 0.7,
  }));

  return [
    {
      url: baseUrl,
      lastModified: new Date(),
      changeFrequency: 'daily',
      priority: 1,
    },
    ...itemUrls,
  ];
}
```

### Sitemap Index for Large Sites

```tsx
// app/server-sitemap-index.xml/route.ts
import { getServerSideSitemapIndex } from 'next-sitemap';

export async function GET() {
  // Get total count
  const totalItems = await getItemCount();
  const perSitemap = 5000;
  const sitemapCount = Math.ceil(totalItems / perSitemap);
  
  // Generate sitemap URLs
  const sitemaps = Array.from({ length: sitemapCount }, (_, i) => 
    `https://example.com/sitemap-${i}.xml`
  );
  
  return getServerSideSitemapIndex(sitemaps);
}

// app/sitemap-[id].xml/route.ts
import { getServerSideSitemap } from 'next-sitemap';

export async function GET(
  request: Request,
  { params }: { params: { id: string } }
) {
  const page = parseInt(params.id);
  const perPage = 5000;
  
  const items = await getItemsPaginated(page, perPage);
  
  const fields = items.map(item => ({
    loc: `https://example.com/${item.category}/${item.slug}`,
    lastmod: item.updatedAt.toISOString(),
  }));
  
  return getServerSideSitemap(fields);
}
```

## Schema Markup & Structured Data

Structured data is **essential for pSEO** - it enables rich results in Google.

### JSON-LD Implementation

```tsx
// components/SchemaMarkup.tsx
import Script from 'next/script';

interface SchemaProps {
  type: 'Product' | 'SoftwareApplication' | 'Article' | 'LocalBusiness' | 'FAQPage';
  data: any;
}

export function SchemaMarkup({ type, data }: SchemaProps) {
  const schema = generateSchema(type, data);
  
  return (
    <Script
      id={`schema-${type}`}
      type="application/ld+json"
      dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: JSON.stringify(schema) }}
    />
  );
}

function generateSchema(type: string, data: any) {
  switch (type) {
    case 'SoftwareApplication':
      return {
        '@context': 'https://schema.org',
        '@type': 'SoftwareApplication',
        name: data.name,
        description: data.description,
        applicationCategory: data.category,
        operatingSystem: 'Web',
        offers: {
          '@type': 'Offer',
          price: data.price || '0',
          priceCurrency: 'USD',
        },
        aggregateRating: data.rating ? {
          '@type': 'AggregateRating',
          ratingValue: data.rating,
          ratingCount: data.reviewCount,
        } : undefined,
      };
      
    case 'Article':
      return {
        '@context': 'https://schema.org',
        '@type': 'Article',
        headline: data.title,
        description: data.description,
        image: data.image,
        datePublished: data.publishedAt,
        dateModified: data.updatedAt,
        author: {
          '@type': 'Person',
          name: data.author,
        },
      };
      
    case 'FAQPage':
      return {
        '@context': 'https://schema.org',
        '@type': 'FAQPage',
        mainEntity: data.questions.map((q: any) => ({
          '@type': 'Question',
          name: q.question,
          acceptedAnswer: {
            '@type': 'Answer',
            text: q.answer,
          },
        })),
      };
      
    case 'BreadcrumbList':
      return {
        '@context': 'https://schema.org',
        '@type': 'BreadcrumbList',
        itemListElement: data.items.map((item: any, index: number) => ({
          '@type': 'ListItem',
          position: index + 1,
          name: item.name,
          item: item.url,
        })),
      };
      
    default:
      return data;
  }
}
```

### Using next-seo Library

```tsx
// components/ProductSchema.tsx
import { ProductJsonLd, FAQPageJsonLd, BreadcrumbJsonLd } from 'next-seo';

export function ProductPageSchema({ product, breadcrumbs, faqs }) {
  return (
    <>
      <ProductJsonLd
        productName={product.name}
        images={[product.image]}
        description={product.description}
        brand={product.brand}
        aggregateRating={{
          ratingValue: product.rating,
          reviewCount: product.reviewCount,
        }}
        offers={{
          price: product.price,
          priceCurrency: 'USD',
          availability: 'https://schema.org/InStock',
        }}
      />
      
      <BreadcrumbJsonLd
        itemListElements={breadcrumbs.map((crumb, i) => ({
          position: i + 1,
          name: crumb.name,
          item: crumb.url,
        }))}
      />
      
      {faqs && faqs.length > 0 && (
        <FAQPageJsonLd
          mainEntity={faqs.map(faq => ({
            questionName: faq.question,
            acceptedAnswerText: faq.answer,
          }))}
        />
      )}
    </>
  );
}
```

| **Screaming Frog** | Technical SEO crawler | [screamingfrog.co.uk](https://www.screamingfrog.co.uk) |

### Data Sources for pSEO

- **APIs**: Product databases, government data, financial APIs
- **Web scraping**: (with permission) competitor data, public datasets
- **User-generated**: Reviews, comments, community content
- **AI-generated**: GPT for unique descriptions (with human editing)
- **Aggregated**: Combine multiple data sources

### Content Generation

```tsx
// lib/content-generator.ts
import OpenAI from 'openai';

const openai = new OpenAI();

export async function generateProductDescription(product: {
  name: string;
  features: string[];
  category: string;
}) {
  const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: 'gpt-4o',
    messages: [
      {
        role: 'system',
        content: `You are an expert product writer. Write unique, 
        helpful product descriptions. Focus on benefits, not just features.
        Be concise but informative. Avoid generic marketing speak.`
      },
      {
        role: 'user',
        content: `Write a 150-word description for ${product.name}, 
        a ${product.category} tool with these features: ${product.features.join(', ')}`
      }
    ],
    max_tokens: 300,
  });
  
  return response.choices[0].message.content;
}
```

**⚠️ Important**: AI-generated content must add value. Google penalizes "scaled content abuse" - mass-produced content with little value. Always:
- Add unique data points
- Include user reviews/testimonials
- Provide genuinely useful information
- Have humans review and edit

---

## Google Algorithm Considerations & Gotchas

### What Google Says About Scaled Content

From Google's Spam Policies:

> **Scaled content abuse** is when many pages are generated for the primary purpose of manipulating search rankings and not helping users. This includes:
> - Using generative AI tools to generate many pages without adding value
> - Scraping feeds or search results to generate many pages
> - Stitching or combining content from different web pages without adding value
> - Creating many pages where the content makes little or no sense

### How to Stay Safe

1. **Add Genuine Value**
   - Unique data points not found elsewhere
   - Original analysis or insights
   - User-generated content (reviews, comments)
   - Proprietary tools or calculators

2. **Quality Over Quantity**
   - Better to have 10k excellent pages than 100k thin ones
   - Each page should answer a real user query
   - If you wouldn't want to land on the page, don't publish it

3. **Avoid Doorway Pages**
   - Don't create multiple similar pages targeting slight keyword variations
   - Bad: `/best-crm-denver`, `/top-crm-denver`, `/crm-software-denver`
   - Good: `/crm-software/denver` with comprehensive content

4. **Crawl Budget Management**
   - Google has limited crawl budget for your site
   - Block low-value pages in robots.txt
   - Use `noindex` for filter/sort variations
   - Keep sitemaps up to date
   - Return proper 404s for removed pages
   - Avoid long redirect chains

### Common pSEO Failures

| Failure | Why It Happens | Solution |
|---------|----------------|----------|
| **Thin content** | Template + minimal data | Add 300+ words unique content per page |
| **Duplicate content** | Same template, similar data | Ensure 70%+ unique content per page |
| **Indexing issues** | Too many similar pages | Use canonical tags, consolidate |
| **Slow crawling** | Crawl budget exhausted | Prioritize important pages |
| **Manual penalty** | Google spam detection | Focus on user value |
| **Cannibalization** | Multiple pages for same keyword | One page per intent |

### Canonical Tags

Prevent duplicate content issues:

```tsx
// In generateMetadata
export async function generateMetadata({ params }) {
  return {
    alternates: {
      canonical: `https://example.com/${params.category}/${params.slug}`,
    },
  };
}
```

### Handling Filters & Sorting

```tsx
// For pages with filters, use noindex
export const metadata = {
  robots: {
    index: false, // Don't index filter pages
    follow: true, // But follow links
  },
};

// Or block in robots.txt
// Disallow: /*?sort=
// Disallow: /*?filter=
```

# Ralph Vs Clawdbot

# Ralph Wiggum vs Clawdbot: Autonomous AI Workflows Compared

*Research compiled January 2026*

---

## What is Ralph Wiggum?

**Ralph Wiggum** is a technique created by [@GeoffreyHuntley](https://ghuntley.com/ralph) — in its purest form, it's a bash `while` loop that restarts Claude Code with the same prompt whenever it exits:

```bash
while :; do cat PROMPT.md | claude-code ; done
```

That's it. That's the whole thing.

The name is a reference to the dim-but-lovable Simpsons character — the technique is "deterministically bad in an undeterministic world." Ralph will make mistakes, but those mistakes are identifiable and fixable through prompt tuning.

### The Philosophy

From Geoffrey Huntley's writings:

> "Building software with Ralph requires a great deal of faith and a belief in eventual consistency. Ralph will test you. Every time Ralph has taken a wrong direction, I haven't blamed the tools; instead, I've looked inside. Each time Ralph does something bad, Ralph gets tuned - like a guitar."

The key insight: **software is now clay on the pottery wheel**. If something isn't right, you throw it back on the wheel.

### What Ralph Has Built

- **CURSED** — A complete GenZ programming language with compiler (LLVM-backed), standard library, and tooling. Built over 3 months of continuous Ralph loops.
- Multiple greenfield projects at production scale
- "Ralph can replace the majority of outsourcing at most companies for greenfield projects"

### The PROMPT.md

Geoffrey keeps exact prompts private, but the structure is:
1. Allocate context with specifications (see [ghuntley.com/specs](https://ghuntley.com/specs))
2. Give Ralph a single clear goal
3. Loop the goal

Example pattern for cursed:
```markdown
study specs/* to learn about the programming language. When authoring 
the CURSED standard library think extra extra hard as the CURSED 
programming language is not in your training data set and may be invalid. 
Come up with a plan to implement XYZ as markdown then do it
```

---

## Ralph's Merkabah (Multi-Agent Variant)

The "Merkabah" concept refers to **nested Ralph loops** or **parallel Ralph workers** — essentially running multiple autonomous loops coordinating on a larger task.

### Current State (as of January 2026)

From Huntley's writing on multi-agent:

> "While I was in SFO, everyone seemed to be trying to crack on multi-agent, agent-to-agent communication and multiplexing. At this stage, it's not needed. Consider microservices and all the complexities that come with them. Now, consider what microservices would look like if the microservices (agents) themselves are non-deterministic—a red hot mess."

**His recommendation:** Stay monolithic. Ralph works autonomously in a single repository as a single process that performs **one task per loop**.

### The Loom Project

Huntley is building something called "[The Weaving Loom](https://github.com/ghuntley/loom)" — infrastructure for "evolutionary software":

> "Loom is essentially infrastructure for evolutionary software. Gas Town focuses on spinning plates and orchestration - a full level 8. I'm going for a level 9 where autonomous loops evolve products and optimize automatically for revenue generation. Evolutionary software - also known as a software factory."

Key insight: The future isn't multi-agent chaos, it's **orchestrated autonomous loops with clear boundaries**.

---

## Limitations of Ralph Wiggum

### 1. No Memory Between Loops
- Each loop iteration starts fresh
- Can't learn from previous mistakes within the same task
- No persistent context about what was tried before
- Must re-read entire PROMPT.md and specs each iteration

### 2. Can't Interact Mid-Task
- Ralph runs unattended — you come back hours later to see results
- No way to course-correct mid-execution
- No progress updates or status checks
- If it goes off-rails, you only find out when it's done

### 3. Gets Stuck in Infinite/Repetitive Loops
- Can repeat the same bad approach indefinitely
- No circuit breaker for "tried this 5 times, try something else"
- Context window fills with failed attempts
- Requires manual CTRL+C and prompt tuning

### 4. Single Task Focus
- One Ralph = one task in one repo
- No coordination between multiple work streams
- Can't pause task A to handle urgent task B
- Sequential by design

### 5. No External Communication
- Can't notify you when something important happens
- Can't ask for clarification
- Can't report progress
- Fully fire-and-forget

### 6. Context Window Degradation
- Long-running loops accumulate context
- Performance degrades as window fills
- "The more you allocate to a context window, the worse the performance"
- Eventual consistency requires waiting for degradation

---

## How Clawdbot Solves These Problems

### 1. Persistent Memory System

**Daily logs:** `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- Raw chronological record of what happened
- Survives session restarts
- Cross-referenceable across days

**Long-term memory:** `MEMORY.md`
- Curated, distilled insights
- Updated during heartbeats
- Personal context that matters

**Workspace files:** `AGENTS.md`, `TOOLS.md`, `SOUL.md`
- Identity and behavior configuration
- Environment-specific notes
- Skill configurations

```markdown
# Example: Memory carries forward
Today: "Tried approach X for the auth refactor, hit rate limiting"
Tomorrow: *reads yesterday's notes* "Already tried X, let's try Y"
```

### 2. Heartbeat System for Check-ins

Unlike Ralph's fire-and-forget, Clawdbot has scheduled heartbeats:

```markdown
**Things to check (rotate through these, 2-4 times per day):**
- Emails - Any urgent unread messages?
- Calendar - Upcoming events in next 24-48h?
- Mentions - Twitter/social notifications?
- Weather - Relevant if your human might go out?
```

**Benefits:**
- Regular touchpoints even during autonomous work
- Can pivot priorities mid-stream
- Progress visibility without interrupting flow
- Natural "checkpoint" opportunities

### 3. Sub-Agent Spawning (sessions_spawn)

Clawdbot can spawn sub-agents for parallel work:

```
# Main agent spawns focused workers
"Research this topic" → subagent handles it
"Process these files" → another subagent
"Monitor this endpoint" → yet another

# Each subagent:
- Gets focused task context
- Reports back when done
- Isolated failure domain
```

**vs Ralph:** Ralph is monolithic. Clawdbot can parallelize with coordination.

### 4. Mid-Task Communication

Clawdbot integrates with messaging:
- **Telegram** — Real-time back-and-forth
- **Discord** — Group context awareness
- **Email** — Async notifications

This means:
- Course-correct mid-task: "Actually, focus on the API first"
- Ask clarifying questions without stopping
- Report blockers immediately
- Human-in-the-loop when needed

### 5. Skills System for Extensibility

```
skills/
├── claude-connect/    # Auth token management
├── web-search/        # Research capabilities
├── calendar/          # Scheduling awareness
└── custom-tools/      # Whatever you build
```

Each skill has:
- `SKILL.md` — Documentation and usage
- Scripts and tools
- Integration hooks

**vs Ralph:** Ralph relies on whatever tools Claude Code has. Clawdbot can be extended indefinitely.

## Implementing "Ralph-like" Autonomous Workflows in Clawdbot

### Pattern 1: Long-Running Sub-Agent Tasks

Instead of a bash while loop, spawn a dedicated sub-agent:

```markdown
# In HEARTBEAT.md or via direct command:

Spawn a subagent for: "Build the authentication module"
- Context: Link to specs/auth.md
- Timeout: 4 hours
- Checkpoint: Every 30 minutes, update memory/auth-progress.md
```

**Advantages over Ralph:**
- Can check progress via memory files
- Main agent remains responsive
- Sub-agent can be killed/redirected mid-task
- Results persist in structured memory

### Pattern 2: Task Breakdown with Coordination

Ralph does one big task. Clawdbot can orchestrate:

```markdown
# Main agent coordinates
1. Spawn subagent A: "Design the database schema" → saves to specs/db.md
2. Wait for completion, review output
3. Spawn subagent B: "Implement migrations based on specs/db.md"
4. Spawn subagent C: "Write API endpoints for the schema"
5. Final review and integration

# Each step:
- Isolated context window (no degradation)
- Clear inputs/outputs
- Human checkpoints available
```

### Pattern 3: Error Handling and Recovery

```markdown
# In a long-running task, include in the prompt:

## Recovery Protocol
If you encounter the same error 3 times:
1. Document the error in memory/errors-YYYY-MM-DD.md
2. Try an alternative approach
3. If still stuck, notify via heartbeat: "Blocked on: [description]"

If context window is getting large:
1. Summarize progress to memory/task-checkpoint.md
2. Stop current work
3. New session will read checkpoint and continue
```

### Pattern 4: Progress Reporting via Heartbeats

```markdown
# HEARTBEAT.md for autonomous work:

## Current Tasks
- [ ] Auth module refactor (in progress)

## Check Protocol
1. Read memory/auth-progress.md
2. If no update in 2 hours, check on the subagent
3. If blocked, escalate to user
4. If complete, mark done and report
```

### Pattern 5: The "Supervised Ralph"

Combine Ralph's simplicity with Clawdbot's oversight:

```bash
# supervised-ralph.sh
while :; do
    # Run the task
    cat PROMPT.md | claude-code > output.log 2>&1
    
    # Post-loop: Have Clawdbot review
    echo "Ralph iteration complete. Review output.log and update memory." | clawdbot message
    
    # Wait for approval (or timeout)
    sleep 300
    
    # Check if should continue
    if [ -f ".stop-ralph" ]; then
        break
    fi
done
```

Clawdbot reviews each iteration, updates memory, can inject course corrections, and stops the loop when needed.

## When to Use Which

### Use Pure Ralph When:
- ✅ Greenfield project, clear specs
- ✅ Single focused task
- ✅ You can walk away for hours/days
- ✅ Cost isn't a concern
- ✅ Minimal human oversight needed
- ✅ You trust the model + your prompt tuning

### Use Clawdbot When:
- ✅ Ongoing assistant relationship
- ✅ Multiple concurrent tasks
- ✅ Need mid-task communication
- ✅ Human-in-the-loop checkpoints
- ✅ Memory continuity matters
- ✅ Integration with other systems (calendar, email, etc.)
- ✅ Team/shared context environments

### Hybrid Approach:
- Use Clawdbot as the orchestrator
- Spawn "Ralph-like" sub-agents for focused work
- Main agent maintains memory and coordination
- Best of both worlds

## Key Insights from Geoffrey Huntley

1. **"Software is now clay on the pottery wheel"** — Don't fight mistakes, reshape them
2. **"Everything is a Ralph loop"** — Even complex workflows decompose to: goal → loop → tune
3. **"LLMs are mirrors of operator skill"** — Your outcomes reflect your prompting ability
4. **"Less is more"** — Don't over-allocate context, keep it focused
5. **"The models do the heavy lifting"** — The harness (Cursor, Claude Code, Clawdbot) is just 300 lines running a loop

---

## Conclusion

Ralph Wiggum is elegant in its simplicity: a while loop that throws tokens at a problem until it's solved. It's perfect for focused, unattended work.

Clawdbot adds the infrastructure for **sustainable autonomous work**: memory, communication, coordination, and extensibility. It's the difference between a single-use robot and a persistent assistant.

The future is probably somewhere in between: **orchestrated autonomous loops with human touchpoints**. Use Ralph's simplicity for focused work, Clawdbot's infrastructure for coordination and memory.

Or as Huntley might say: tune your guitar, trust the loop, and build the future while you're AFK.

### Key Tools for Scraping

```javascript
// Color extraction from existing site
const ColorThief = require('colorthief');
const colors = await ColorThief.getPalette(logoUrl, 5);
// Returns: [[r,g,b], [r,g,b], ...] - primary colors

// Content scraping with Playwright
const { chromium } = require('playwright');
const browser = await chromium.launch();
const page = await browser.newPage();
await page.goto(prospectUrl);

const data = await page.evaluate(() => ({
  title: document.title,
  logo: document.querySelector('header img')?.src,
  phone: document.body.innerText.match(/\(?\d{3}\)?[-.\s]?\d{3}[-.\s]?\d{4}/)?.[0],
  services: [...document.querySelectorAll('h2, h3')].map(el => el.textContent)
}));
```

// deploy.js
const { execSync } = require('child_process');

async function deployProspectSite(prospectSlug, sitePath) {
  // Deploy to Vercel with custom alias
  const result = execSync(`
    cd ${sitePath} && \
    vercel deploy --prod --yes \
    --scope your-team \
    --token $VERCEL_TOKEN
  `);
  
  // Set custom alias
  execSync(`
    vercel alias set ${result.toString().trim()} \
    ${prospectSlug}.preview.youragency.com \
    --token $VERCEL_TOKEN
  `);
  
  return `https://${prospectSlug}.preview.youragency.com`;
}
```

### DNS Setup for Wildcard Subdomains

```
# Cloudflare DNS (or your registrar)

  });
  
  // Mobile screenshots
  const mobilePage = await context.newPage();
  await mobilePage.setViewportSize({ width: 375, height: 667 });
  
  await mobilePage.goto(`https://${oldSite}`);
  await mobilePage.screenshot({ path: `${outputDir}/old-mobile.png` });
  
  await mobilePage.goto(newSite);
  await mobilePage.screenshot({ path: `${outputDir}/new-mobile.png` });
  
  await browser.close();
  
  // Create side-by-side comparison
  await createComparison(
    `${outputDir}/old-desktop.png`,
    `${outputDir}/new-desktop.png`,
    `${outputDir}/comparison-desktop.png`
  );
  
  return {

  };
}

async function createComparison(oldPath, newPath, outputPath) {
  const old = sharp(oldPath).resize(700, null);
  const newImg = sharp(newPath).resize(700, null);
  
  // Get heights for consistent sizing
  const oldMeta = await old.metadata();
  const height = oldMeta.height;
  
  await sharp({
    create: {
      width: 1440,
      height: height + 60,
      channels: 4,
      background: { r: 30, g: 30, b: 30, alpha: 1 }
    }
  })
  .composite([
    { input: await old.toBuffer(), left: 10, top: 50 },
    { input: await newImg.resize(700, height).toBuffer(), left: 730, top: 50 },

## 10. Security & Legal Considerations

### Content Usage
- **Scraping:** Only use publicly available information
- **Images:** Re-upload to your own CDN (don't hotlink)
- **Reviews:** Link back to Google, don't claim as your own testimonials
- **Logos:** Use as-is for personalization, make clear it's a demo

### Preview Site Disclaimers
Add footer to all preview sites:
```html
<footer class="preview-disclaimer">
  This is a demonstration website created by [Your Agency]. 
  Not affiliated with or endorsed by [Business Name].
  <a href="mailto:contact@youragency.com">Contact us</a> to discuss your project.
</footer>
```

### Data Handling
- Don't store scraped data long-term
- Auto-delete preview sites after 30 days
- Clear prospect data on request

### How It Works
```typescript
// Inngest durable function example
export default inngest.createFunction(
  {
    id: "process-order",
    concurrency: { key: "event.data.userId", limit: 5 }
  },
  { event: "order/created" },
  async ({ event, step }) => {
    // Each step is individually retried on failure
    const validated = await step.run("validate", async () => {
      return validateOrder(event.data);
    });
    
    await step.run("charge", async () => {
      return chargeCard(validated);
    });
    
    await step.run("fulfill", async () => {
      return fulfillOrder(validated);
    });
  }
);
```

### Installation (Mac mini)

### Setup Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# setup-local-ai-stack.sh

# 1. Install Ollama (runs natively on Mac for best performance)
brew install ollama
ollama serve &

# 2. Pull recommended models
ollama pull llama3.2
ollama pull mistral
ollama pull nomic-embed-text  # For embeddings

# 3. Clone and start Sim Studio
git clone https://github.com/simstudioai/sim.git
cd sim

# 4. Start with external Ollama
OLLAMA_URL=http://host.docker.internal:11434 \
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d

echo "✅ Stack ready!"
echo "   Sim Studio: http://localhost:3000"
echo "   Ollama API: http://localhost:11434"
```

### Alternative: n8n AI Starter Kit

If you need more general automation beyond AI:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/self-hosted-ai-starter-kit.git
cd self-hosted-ai-starter-kit
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env: Set OLLAMA_HOST=host.docker.internal:11434

# Install Ollama separately for Mac
brew install ollama
ollama serve &
ollama pull llama3.2

# Start n8n stack
docker compose up

# n8n: http://localhost:5678
```

## Resource Requirements

### Mac mini Specifications

| Component | Minimum | Recommended |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **RAM** | 8GB | 16GB+ |
| **Storage** | 50GB free | 100GB+ SSD |
| **CPU** | M1 | M1 Pro/Max or M2+ |
| **Docker** | Docker Desktop | Docker Desktop |

### Per-Tool Memory Usage

| Tool | Idle RAM | Active RAM |
|------|----------|------------|
| Sim Studio | ~500MB | 1-2GB |
| n8n | ~300MB | 500MB-1GB |
| Ollama (7B model) | ~5GB | 5-8GB |
| Ollama (13B model) | ~10GB | 10-14GB |
| Qdrant | ~200MB | 500MB-2GB |
| PostgreSQL | ~100MB | 200-500MB |

**Recommendation:** With 16GB RAM, you can comfortably run:
- Sim or n8n
- Ollama with 7B-8B models
- Qdrant for vector storage
- PostgreSQL for data

---

## Conclusion

### For Marb's Mac mini, I recommend:

1. **Primary: Sim Studio** - Best for AI agent workflows with native MCP support
2. **Ollama** - Run locally for best Mac performance (not in Docker)
3. **Qdrant** - Vector database for RAG workflows
4. **PostgreSQL with pgvector** - Included with Sim

### Why Sim over n8n for AI workflows?

| Aspect | Sim | n8n |
|--------|-----|-----|
| AI-First Design | ✅ Built for agents | ⚪ AI is an add-on |
| MCP Integration | ✅ Native support | ❌ Not available |
| Ollama Integration | ✅ First-class | ⚪ Via sub-node |
| Visual Agent Building | ✅ Excellent | ⚪ Good |
| General Integrations | ⚪ 80+ | ✅ 400+ |

**If you need 400+ integrations** for non-AI automation, use **n8n** alongside Sim.

---

## Quick Reference Commands

```bash
# Start Sim with local Ollama
OLLAMA_URL=http://host.docker.internal:11434 \
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d

# Pull new Ollama model
ollama pull codellama:7b

# Check Sim logs
docker compose logs -f sim

# Stop everything
docker compose down

# Backup Sim database
docker exec simstudio-db pg_dump -U postgres simstudio > backup.sql
```
