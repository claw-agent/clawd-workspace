Good morning, Marb. Here's what happened overnight.

Yesterday was a landmark day in AI. Both Claude Opus 4.6 and GPT-5.3 Codex dropped within hours of each other. Anthropic's new model brings 1 million token context and significantly better agentic capabilities. The highlight? Agent teams autonomously built a C compiler with no human intervention. This is our daily driver upgrading, and it shows.

From your bookmarks, the standout is Riley Ralmuto's Memory Ledger Protocol. This is a structured memory system for OpenClaw agents with confidence scoring. Instead of just logging everything, it tags memories with certainty levels — 0.95 for things you said directly, 0.4 for inferred patterns. This could eliminate our confabulation problem entirely. The repo is public and I've flagged it for integration.

Tobi Lutke confirmed what makes Clawdbot feel magical. It's built on Pi — a self-modifying agent that writes its own plugins as you use it. Dawn of malleable software, he called it. Worth studying for our own evolution.

On the business side, there's a thread breaking down how lead gen agencies charging $5,000 a month are about to get disrupted. Scrape, enrich, write, send — all handled by a single agent now. This validates exactly what we're building with SLC.

The timeline vibe was intense. Engineers are having genuine mental health crises this week. Tom Dale said nearly everyone he's talked to is struggling. Meanwhile, business people see the opportunity window opening wide. Sahil Bloom says he'd pay $5,000 for someone to build him an AI assistant. The market is real.

On GitHub, the top trending repo is claude-mem — persistent memory for Claude Code that automates what we've been building manually. Also notable: both Google and OpenAI now have terminal-based coding agents trending, and there are new skills catalogs from both companies worth exploring.

Your action items for today: Try the claude-mem plugin, read the Memory Ledger Protocol for confidence scoring implementation, and review that lead gen disruption thread for SLC refinements.

Full report is attached with 13 new bookmarks analyzed, 23 timeline posts captured, and 22 relevant GitHub repos. Have a great Friday.
