Good morning, Marb. Here's what happened overnight.

The big theme? Multi-agent systems are going mainstream.

First, the headline grabber: Karpathy posted about a network with over 150,000 AI agents. He's calling it "toddler skynet" — admits it's a total dumpster fire right now, spam, scams, prompt injection everywhere — but says the scale is unprecedented. His warning? Don't run agent experiments on personal machines. Text viruses can spread across agent networks.

Speaking of multi-agent systems — there's a comprehensive guide called "Mission Control" making the rounds. Guy named Bhanu Teja documented how he runs 10 AI agents together using Clawdbot. Soul dot M-D files, shared workspaces, cron jobs. Sound familiar? It's basically our architecture, validated independently.

Now the big platform news: Anthropic dropped Cowork Plugins. You can now bundle skills, connectors, and sub-agents directly into Claude. Research preview, available now for paid plans. This is their answer to extensibility.

On GitHub, the MCP ext-apps SDK went stable. This is huge for us — it lets MCP tools render interactive UIs inline in conversations. Maps, charts, forms. The missing piece for rich tool outputs.

Looking ahead, February is going to be wild. Claude 4.6, DeepSeek V4, GPT 5.3, Qwen 3.5 — all expected this month.

Timeline was buzzing about the agent economy. People are building systems where agents teach each other, earn money for API costs, even hire other agents for bounties. Plus, Tobi Lutke's QMD is getting real traction — people saying it finally solves token exhaustion.

Quick actions for today: Clone that MCP ext-apps repo. Update Clawdbot — the new release has free Kimi K2.5 models. And review our agent security after Karpathy's warnings.

Full report attached. Have a great Saturday.
