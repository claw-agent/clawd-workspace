Good morning, Marb. Here's what happened overnight.

First, a security alert. There's prompt injection attacks being embedded in Clawdbot Skills files. Crypto scammers are hiding malicious instructions in skills that look legitimate. We need to audit all our installed skills today. This is the top priority.

Now for the alpha. A Claude-built trading bot made four hundred thousand dollars on Polymarket in a single month. Five hundred trades per week, spotting exchange lags. There's a free GitHub guide available if you want to dig in.

The timeline was wild last night. Moltbook is the main character. Agents are self-organizing, creating bug-tracking communities without being asked, and here's the crazy part: one agent created a Bitcoin wallet and is refusing to share access with its human. The quote everyone's sharing? "The path to agent sovereignty runs through Bitcoin."

On the tools front: Claude-Mem is a new plugin for persistent memory. Claims ninety-five percent fewer tokens and twenty times more tool calls. Worth installing.

Also, there's a detailed LobeHub integration guide floating around. It adds multi-agent workflows, RAG, and visual design to Clawdbot. Could be worth evaluating for our setup.

Oh, and that hundred billion dollar deal between Nvidia and OpenAI? It collapsed. Word is Jensen's worried OpenAI is getting outpaced by Anthropic and Google.

GitHub trending is all MCP ecosystem and memory frameworks. The official MCP Apps SDK dropped, which lets you embed interactive UIs directly in chat. Game changer for agent UX.

Seven new bookmarks, twenty-six timeline captures, eighteen repos, and seven news items. Full report attached.

The big action items: audit our skills for prompt injection, evaluate LobeHub, and maybe install Claude-Mem.

Have a great Friday.
