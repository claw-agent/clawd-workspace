☕ Morning Intel — Feb 14, 2026
Happy Valentine's Day. Big overnight.

🔥 TOP 5

1. Google WebMCP — Chrome 146 turns websites into native agent APIs. Declarative + Imperative modes. "25x fewer tokens, 50x faster." Biggest agent infra shift since MCP.

2. GPT-5.2 Physics Discovery — Derived a new formula for gluon scattering after 12h reasoning. First credible AI-as-scientist result. 10K+ posts.

3. Brave LLM Context API — Revamped search with 35B page index, <600ms, $5/1K. Beats ChatGPT & Perplexity in testing. We already have Brave MCP integrated.

4. Seedance 2.0 Everywhere — Hollywood backlash (17K posts), complete mastery guide dropped, and moyin-creator on GitHub provides full script→video pipeline with Seedance 2.0 support. Dreamina via CapCut confirmed as best access path.

5. OpenClaw Trending — 1.3K posts on X. Agent ecosystem exploding on GitHub (tinyclaw, claw-compactor, x-research-skill all trending).
