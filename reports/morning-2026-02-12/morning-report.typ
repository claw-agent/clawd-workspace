= Morning Intel — February 12, 2026

== TL;DR

- *GLM-5 dropped* — new open-weights leader targeting agentic tasks; GGUF quants already available for local runs
- *Seedance 2.0 now globally accessible* via ChatCut — major upgrade for our Red Rising video pipeline
- *Claude Code SEO powerstack* (Keywords Everywhere + DataForSEO) could automate XPERIENCE SEO overnight

== Top 5 Highlights

=== 1. GLM-5: Open Weights Agentic Leader #sym.star#sym.star#sym.star#sym.star#sym.star
Z.ai released GLM-5 targeting complex systems engineering and long-horizon agentic tasks. Claims open weights leadership with score of 50 on Intelligence Index. Unsloth already has GGUF quantizations. Could run locally via Ollama. Notably did NOT compare against Opus 4.6.

=== 2. Seedance 2.0 Goes Global #sym.star#sym.star#sym.star#sym.star#sym.star
ByteDance's video gen model now available worldwide through ChatCut. Three separate bookmarks on this — strong signal. Emad Mostaque reports 10-min videos for \$60 in \~8 hours. Direct upgrade path for Red Rising scenes.

=== 3. Claude Code SEO Powerstack #sym.star#sym.star#sym.star#sym.star
\@codyschneiderxx shared a Claude Code workflow using Keywords Everywhere API + DataForSEO for full keyword universe, SERP gap analysis, and programmatic content calendars. Immediately applicable to XPERIENCE.

=== 4. HBR Study: AI Intensifies Work #sym.star#sym.star#sym.star#sym.star
8-month field study at 200-person tech company found AI expanded task scope rather than reducing workload. Workers took on more roles, creating coordination overhead. Important framing for how we pitch AI to clients.

=== 5. Chrome DevTools MCP Server #sym.star#sym.star#sym.star#sym.star
Official Google-backed MCP server for Chrome DevTools. Gives coding agents full browser inspection — performance traces, network analysis, console, screenshots. Works with Claude Code natively.
