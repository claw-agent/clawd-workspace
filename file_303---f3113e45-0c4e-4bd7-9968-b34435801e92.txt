I feel like this is kind of complicated, and I feel like it's missing some things,
especially when I'm looking up above when you say you got the full thing analyzed.
I would love for you to actually take everything from my voice note that you organized
and that you have in the deep dive doc and just send it to me as a PDF,
then I'll go through that.
Just because I feel like this way we're doing it is skipping some things,
and so I'll probably just leave you another voice note on that once you send it.
