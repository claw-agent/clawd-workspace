I think we're all good for tonight.
One last thing that I just want to make sure is that you're still feeling like you can be proactive
and that we're still following that proactive plan that we put together.
I noticed that you didn't do any today, and that's totally fine,
but I just want to make sure that we still have that implemented
and that you're still feeling like you have the agency to do what you want.
