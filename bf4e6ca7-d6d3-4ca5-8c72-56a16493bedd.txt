One question that I think is going to be kind of challenging but something I want you to look into for me is,
is there a way to get LIDAR roofs, like basically if you go through like residential areas,
without actually physically being there, how to get LIDAR scans of the roofs from some sort of open source
or even a cheaper software to be able to use in roofing estimations?
