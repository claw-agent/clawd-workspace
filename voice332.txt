Okay, I'm going to start reading through the report.
The prompt repetition hack is really interesting,
showing that posting the same prompt twice dramatically improves LLM accuracy.
I'm really curious on how we could implement that.
You say zero code, implement ROI for our agent pipelines.
Is this just literally as simple as feeding agents the same prompt twice?
If so, I would love to start figuring that out on how we can actually implement that.
Okay.
It's really interesting.
I'm on the top three highlights now on number two,
the CEO survey showing it shows no measurable impact.
That's pretty surprising.
But also if companies are failing at integration,
then the AI integrator model could be really interesting.
One just quick follow-up here.
You kind of know what I'm doing for experience.
And like say this doesn't work out today or whatever.
What kind of job title or something that I could go promote myself to other companies
that I can offer is the AI integrator,
but maybe something a little bit better and maybe a small job description there.
That'd be great if you could draft that for me.

I'm pretty curious on Sigil's the automation, self-funding, self-replicating AI.
How would you guess that the AIs are actually making money for themselves?
I'm pretty curious on that front.
So I'm going to go through the bookmarks now.
Okay.
So the first one,
talking about how agents markdown file is the new 10x engineer.
Your config is your multiplier.
Does he give any examples on what his config looks like?
Or is this just like a statement?
Number two,
can we go through the 10-point open cost security hardening checklist
and see what we should implement?
Okay.

Do you think we need on the fifth tweet from the 12 bookmarks,
the forward slash done skill for cloud code?
Like,
would that help us at all or is that redundant?
Number seven,
I would love if you could download that video and do our transcription,
like the way you break it down and then everything that you pull from it
to see the 21 daily open claw uses and compare it to what we have,
what we might be missing.
Um,
um,

um,







































um,




um,







and then everything that you can do.

I'm going to go through the,
from the timeline section,
18 posts captured.
Ooh,
the first one,
I'd love to look more into that.
Tell me if we can use that,
uh,
the clods,
hidden tool,
use case,
or use upgrade,
tool use upgrade.
Yeah.
Um,
what do you think of skill graphs?
The second tweet from that section,
uh,
skill.md.
Is that something we should do?
Okay.
